OUTCOME MEASURES
Cognitive function
test
Mini mental status examination
Berg balance scale Examine static & dynamic balance
6 static & 8 dynamic tasks
Tests community dweling individual
Does not test- turning while walking, gait perturbation
Max score -56 points
Modified BBS score- 36 max
Fall risk - < 45
Fugl meyer test
(stroke)
UE- 66
LE- 34
Balance- 14
Tinnetti performance
(POMA)
16 items
9- Balance
5- dynamic
7- gait
Max score- 28
<18- fall risks
19-24- moderate risk
Checks- perturbation, gait, static balance
Functional reach test- Normal >12.2
< 10- inc fall risk
Older population
Postural stabiloity- requires full ROM shoulder
Measured from 3rd MCP to the object (3 trails)
Balance efficacy
scale
Self report- confidence during ADLS & functional mobility with or without assistance
Multidirectional
reach test
Time up and go
test
10 meter walk test- Dynamic gait
index
6 min walk test 2 min walk test Emory functional
ambulation profile
Walkie- talkie test Functional gait
assessment
Postural stability – forward,back, lateral
Normal >7.6- backward , <1.6- abnormal
Normal >9.4- lateral, <3.8- abnormal
Checks- dynamic balance + mobility + turning component
Postural control + functional mobility during stand up, walk 3m, turning back & sit down
11-20- normal elders
>20 sec- inc risk of fall
>30 sec- at high risk
Gait speed
Is timed using stopwatch to determine velocity
Vestibular, chronic stroke, MS, PD also
Walks on common
Gait speed, head turns, pivot turns, obstacles & stairs
Max score – 24
<19 – fall risk
Calculate distance
PD, brain injury, stroke
Walking distance is recorded in specific 6 min time to determine functional gait and endurance
2 chairs- 18 m apart
Same like above
Acute stroke, amputation
Performed with different terrain
Dual task performance
Distance- 20 ft, turn & return (40 ft)
20 sec or longer- high risk of fall
33 sec or longer- with reciting every other alphabet- high risk
Dynamic gait index (ambulating backward with narrow base of support with eye closed)
Total score is 30
Romberg Proprioceptive to upright
20-30 sec Eyes opend and close
Positive- post column lesion (spondylosis, tumour, tapes dorsalis, IVDP)
Sharper Romberg- tandem stance
Balance evaluation
system test
Postural response, sensory orientation, stability in gait
Total score- 108 points
<50 points- low confidence
STREAM Stroke rehabilitation assessment of movt
Clinical measure of volunatary movt & mobility following stroke
Expanded disability
status scale (EDSS)
MS patient
Score 7 or more pateint is unable work
WOMAC Arthritis scale
HOOS & KOOS Hip disability and OA outcome score
Knee injury and OA outcome score
LEFS Lower extremity functional scale- lower extremity arthoplasty
Barthel index Total 0-20
Less than 20- indicates disbaility’
includes ADL & W/C mobility
no social measure/ only self care, ADL +mobility+ stair climbing.
Post stroke functional outcome
FIM 18-126
Motor component- 13 & 91
Cognitive- 5 & 35
18 items- physical, psychological & social function
Katz scale Instrumental activities of daily living
No W/C
SF 36 Helps with scoring planning & measure the impact of clinical & social intervention
Wagner scale Ulcer depth and the presence of osteomyelitis or gangrene by using the following grades:
grade 0 (pre-or postulcerative lesion),
grade 1 (partial/full thickness ulcer),
grade 2 (probing to tendon or capsule),
grade 3 (deep with osteitis),
grade 4 (partial foot gangrene)
grade 5 (whole foot gangrene)
Braden Scale Predicting ulcer risk
Very High Risk: Total Score 9 or less.
High Risk: Total Score 10-12.
Moderate Risk: Total Score 13-14.
