Resulting solutions (electrolytes) can carry an electrical current by virtue of the migration of the associated ions. When a direct current (DC) is passed between two electrodes in an electrolytic solution, positive ions will be repelled from the anode (+) and negative ions repelled from the cathode (–). The anode will repel the positively charged ion from the electrode and into the body. Electrostatic repulsion of like charges is the driving force for iontophoresis. Direct current is the continuous or uninterrupted unidirectional flow of charged particles. It allows for continuous transmission of the medication and assures maximum ion transfer per unit of applied current. Pulsed, AC, and interferential currents are less effective in meeting the need of causing a local medication effect.",
