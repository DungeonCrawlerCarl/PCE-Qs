Competency Profile for Physiotherapists in Canada
2
Acknowledgements
The development of the Competency Profile for
Physiotherapists in Canada was made possible through the
collaboration of numerous organizations and individuals. This
National Physiotherapy Advisory Group (NPAG) initiative was led
by the Canadian Alliance of Physiotherapy Regulators (CAPR)
and the Canadian Council of Physiotherapy University Programs
(CCPUP). Contributing organizations included Physiotherapy
Education Accreditation Canada (PEAC) and the Canadian
Physiotherapy Association (CPA).
The Steering Group, consisting of Michael Brennan, Kathy
Davidson, Richard Debigaré, Brandy Green, Keith Johnson,
Sharon Switzer-McIntyre, Bernadette Martin, Katya Masnyk, Sue
Murphy, and Linda Woodhouse provided the leadership for the
project.
A dedicated Subject Matter Expert Group that included
physiotherapists from across the country contributed content
expertise. The Subject Matter Expert Group included: Robyn
Davies, Alison Greig, Stephanie Lurch, Marilyn MacKay-Lyons,
Bernadette Martin, Hélène Moffet, William Tung, and Todd
Wolansky.
David Cane of Catalysis Consulting Ltd. and Diane Parker-Taillon
of Parker-Taillon Consulting Inc. served as project consultants.
The high quality of their work is recognized and appreciated by
all involved in this project.
Finally, NPAG is grateful for the input, direction, and guidance
provided by both the subject matter expert team and the
over 1,000 registered physiotherapists across Canada
who responded thoughtfully to the practice survey. These
contributions have ensured that the information presented is
both valid and grounded in the realities of day-to-day practice.
Competency Profile for Physiotherapists in Canada
The “Competency Profile
for Physiotherapists in
Canada” (2017) replaces
the “Essential Competency
Profile for Physiotherapists in
Canada” (2009), the “Essential
Competency Profile for
Physiotherapists in Canada”
(2004) and the “Competency Profile
for Entry-Level Physiotherapists in
Canada” (1998).

Essential
Competencies &
Entry-to-Practice
Milestones
This fourth-generation competency profile is
a foundational document that describes the
essential competencies required of a physio-
therapist in Canada throughout their career and
specific milestones expected of a physiother-
apist at entry to the profession. The point of
“entry-to-practice” is particularly significant as it
represents the time at which learners become
clinicians. It is also the endpoint of the formal
involvement of program accreditors and educa-
tors and the starting point of regulation, continu-
ing professional development, and specializa-
tion.
The Essential Competencies and
Entry-to-Practice Milestones are intended
to provide guidance in a number of areas
including: informing curriculum content, setting
accreditation standards, developing exam
blueprints, and establishing a baseline for areas
of specialization.
A robust methodology based on industry
best practices was used to develop the
material herein. A team of nine subject matter
experts (clinicians and educators) drawn from
across the country worked over a six-month
period to generate associated content. Input
gathered from a series of focus groups with
key stakeholder groups and recent scholarly
literature was also incorporated. The draft set
of competencies and milestones was then
validated via a national survey of practising
physiotherapists. Subject matter experts
reviewed survey results in depth and proffered
a set of final adjustments and recommendations
to the NPAG Steering Committee. On May 3,
2017 these recommendations were reviewed
and accepted. Since that time, all four NPAG
member organizations have officially approved
and endorsed the Essential Competencies and
Entry-to-Practice Milestones through motions of
their respective Boards or Councils.

Context of
Physiotherapy
Practice
i. Description of
Physiotherapy Practice
Physiotherapists are primary
health care practitioners who
consult and collaborate with
clients and others to provide
quality client-centred services.
Physiotherapists contribute to
keeping people productive
throughout their lives by maxi-
mizing function and improving
quality of life. Through evi-
dence-informed practice, phys-
iotherapists prevent, assess,
and treat the impact that injury,
pain, disease, and/or disorders
have on clients’ movement,
function, and health status.
Physiotherapists practise both
independently and as part of
interprofessional teams along
the health system continuum
from primary to tertiary care.
ii. Contexts of Practice
Physiotherapists work within
diverse contexts of practice
which include consideration
of the types of clients, areas
of practices, type and goals of
physiotherapy service, practice
settings, and funding models.
The contexts of practice are
interrelated and also influence
the roles and competencies
that individual physiotherapists
require to practise safely and
effectively.
Competency Profile for Physiotherapists in Canada
iii. Assumptions
A number of overarching as-
sumptions apply to all compe-
tencies described herein.
1. Physiotherapists practise
client-centred care and only
act with the client’s informed
consent;
2. Physiotherapy practice is
evidence-informed, and;
3. Client safety is paramount.
5
Organizational
Structure
A roles-based framework, retained from the 2009 Essential Competency Profile, is used as an
organizational principle. The Essential Competencies and Entry-to-Practice Milestones are set out under
seven domains of physiotherapy practice, as follows:
1. Physiotherapy Expertise
2. Communication
3. Collaboration
4. Management
5. Leadership
6. Scholarship
7. Professionalism

Definitions of
Key Terms
Essential competency:
An essential competency
is a required ability of a
physiotherapist.
Milestone: A milestone is an
ability that is expected of a
physiotherapist at a specific
stage in the career. It is related
to an essential competency.
Entry-to-practice: Entry-to-
practice is the point in time
following completion of
education and assessment
(at the point of licensure as a
physiotherapist).
Entry-to-practice milestone:
An entry-to-practice milestone
is an ability that is expected
of a physiotherapist at entry-
to-practice. It is related to an
essential competency.
Statement of
Entry-to-Practice
Entry-to-practice
physiotherapists have the
ability and responsibility to use
their broad knowledge base
to inform their practice. They
work in an autonomous, safe,
organized manner, and employ
sound clinical decision-making.
Autonomy: They are aware
of and work within the
physiotherapy scope of
practice. They appropriately
seek guidance when they
encounter situations outside of
their ability.
Safety: They are aware of
and consistently comply with
standards and regulations
relevant to their practice
environment. They have an
understanding of the risks,
cautions, contraindications,
and best practices relevant
to conditions commonly
encountered in physiotherapy
practice.
Competency Profile for Physiotherapists in Canada
Proficiency: Proficiency is the
expected level of performance
associated with the milestones
at a defined point in the career.
Entry-to-practice proficiency:
Entry-to-practice proficiency
is the expected level of
performance associated with
the milestones at entry-to-
practice. It is described below.
Organization: They practise in
an organized manner but may
require more time to complete
tasks than an experienced
physiotherapist.
Clinical Decision-Making:
Clinical decision-making
is largely driven by the
knowledge and skills acquired
through academic and clinical
education, rather than by
practice experience. They use
a clinical reasoning approach
that may be more time
consuming and effortful than an
experienced physiotherapist.
