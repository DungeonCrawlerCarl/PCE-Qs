Glossary of Terms
Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI): Any new onset acute respiratory infection that could potentially be
spread by the droplet route (either upper or lower respiratory tract), which presents with symptoms of a
fever greater than 38C and a new or worsening cough or shortness of breath (previously known as
febrile respiratory illness, or FRI). It should be noted that elderly people and people who are
immunocompromised may not have a febrile response to a respiratory infection.
Additional Precautions (AP): Precautions (i.e., Contact Precautions, Droplet Precautions and Airborne
Precautions) that are necessary in addition to Routine Practices for certain pathogens or clinical
presentations. These precautions are based on the method of transmission (e.g., contact, droplet,
airborne).
Administrative Controls: Measures put in place to reduce the risk of infection to staff or to patients
(e.g., infection prevention and control policies/ procedures, education/ training).
Aerosol: Small droplet of moisture that may carry microorganisms. Aerosols may be light enough to
remain suspended in the air for short periods of time, allowing inhalation of the microorganism.
Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR): A room that is designed, constructed and ventilated to limit
the spread of airborne microorganisms from an infected occupant to the surrounding areas of the health
care setting. This is also known as a negative pressure room. NOTE: The Canadian Standards Association
uses the term Airborne Isolation Room, abbreviated AIR.
Airborne Precautions: Used in addition to Routine Practices for clients/patients/residents known or
suspected of having an illness transmitted by the airborne route (i.e., by small droplet nuclei that remain
suspended in the air and may be inhaled by others).
Alcohol-Based Hand Rub (ABHR): A liquid, gel or foam formulation of alcohol (e.g., ethanol,
isopropanol) which is used to reduce the number of microorganisms on hands in clinical situations when
the hands are not visibly soiled. ABHRs contain emollients to reduce skin irritation and are less time-
consuming to use than washing with soap and water.
Antibiotic-Resistant Organism (ARO): A microorganism that has developed resistance to the action of
several antimicrobial agents and that is of special clinical or epidemiological significance.
Barriers: Equipment or objects used to prevent exposure of skin, mucous membranes or clothing of staff
to splashes or sprays of potentially infectious materials.
Carbapenemase: A class of enzymes that inactivate carbapenem antibiotics by hydrolysing them. In
almost all instances, these enzymes hydrolyse not only carbapenem antimicrobials but also first-
,
second- and third-generation cephalosporins and penicillins (e.g., piperacillin-tazobactam). The genetic
information to produce carbapenemases is often located on a mobile genetic element (e.g., plasmid,
transposon), which frequently also carries resistance to other classes of antimicrobials, such as
fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides.
Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE): For the purposes of this document, these are
Enterobacteriaceae that are resistant to carbapenem antimicrobials (e.g., imipenem, meropenem,
ertapenem) through the production of carbapenemase.
Chain of Transmission: A model used to understand the infection process.
CHICA-Canada: The Community and Hospital Infection Control Association of Canada, a professional
organization of persons engaged in infection prevention and control activities in health care settings.
CHICA-Canada members include infection prevention and control professionals from a number of
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 vii
related specialties including nurses, epidemiologists, physicians, microbiology technologists, public
health and industry. The CHICA-Canada website is located at: http://www.chica.org.
Cleaning: The physical removal of foreign material (e.g., dust, soil) and organic material (e.g., blood,
secretions, excretions, microorganisms). Cleaning physically removes rather than kills microorganisms.
It is accomplished with water, detergents and mechanical action.
Client/Patient/Resident: Any person receiving care within a health care setting.
Cohorting: The assignment of a geographic area such as a room or a patient care area to two or more
clients/patients/residents who are either colonized or infected with the same microorganism, with
staffing assignments restricted to the cohorted group of patients. See also, Staff Cohorting.
Colonization: The presence and growth of a microorganism in or on a body with growth and
multiplication but without tissue invasion or cellular injury or symptoms.
Complex Continuing Care (CCC): Continuing, medically complex and specialized services provided to
both young and old, sometimes over extended periods of time. Such care also includes support to
families who have palliative or respite care needs.
Contact Precautions: Used in addition to Routine Practices to reduce the risk of transmitting infectious
agents via contact with an infectious person.
Contamination: The presence of an infectious agent on hands or on a surface, such as clothing, gowns,
gloves, bedding, toys, surgical instruments, care equipment, dressings or other inanimate objects.
Continuum of Care: Across all health care sectors, including settings where emergency (including pre-
hospital) care is provided, hospitals, complex continuing care, rehabilitation hospitals, long-term care
homes, outpatient clinics, community health centres and clinics, physician offices, dental offices, offices
of other health professionals, public health and home health care.
Direct Care: Providing hands-on care (e.g., bathing, washing, turning client/patient/resident, changing
clothes, continence care, dressing changes, care of open wounds/lesions, toileting).
Disinfectant: A product that is used on surfaces or medical equipment/devices which results in
disinfection of the surface or equipment/device. Disinfectants are applied only to inanimate
objects. Some products combine a cleaner with a disinfectant.
Disinfection: The inactivation of disease-producing microorganisms. Disinfection does not destroy
bacterial spores. Medical equipment/devices must be cleaned thoroughly before effective disinfection
can take place. See also, Disinfectant.
Droplet Precautions: Used in addition to Routine Practices for clients/patients/residents known or
suspected of having an infection that can be transmitted by large infectious droplets.
Engineering Controls: Physical or mechanical measures put in place to reduce the risk of infection to
staff or patients (e.g., heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, room design, placement of hand
washing sinks).
Environment of the Client/Patient/Resident: The immediate space around a client/patient/resident
that may be touched by the client/patient/resident and may also be touched by the health care provider
when providing care. In a single room, the client/patient/resident environment is the room. In a multi-
bed room, the client/patient/resident environment is the area inside the individual’s curtain. In an
ambulatory setting, the client/patient/resident environment is the area that may come into contact with
the client/patient/resident within their cubicle. In a nursery/neonatal setting, the patient environment
includes the inside of the bassinette or incubator, as well as the equipment outside the bassinette or
incubator used for that infant (e.g., ventilator, monitor). See also, Health Care Environment.
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 viii
Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL): Enzymes that may be produced by some strains of
Enterobacteriaceae that hydrolyse all cephalosporins, including third-generation cephalosporins such as
cefotaxime, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, as well as aztreonam.
Eye Protection: A device that covers the eyes and is used by health care providers to protect the eyes
when it is anticipated that a procedure or care activity is likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood,
body fluids, secretions or excretions, or within two metres of a coughing client/patient/resident. Eye
protection includes safety glasses, safety goggles, face shields and visors.
Facial Protection: Personal protective equipment that protect the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose
and mouth from splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions or excretions. Facial protection may
include a mask or respirator in conjunction with eye protection, or a face shield that covers eyes, nose
and mouth.
Fit-Check: See Seal-Check
Fit-Test: A qualitative or quantitative method to evaluate the fit of a specific make, model and size of
respirator on an individual. Fit-testing must be done periodically, at least every two years and whenever
there is a change in respirator face piece or the user’s physical condition which could affect the
respirator fit.6
Hand Care Program: A hand care program for staff is a key component of hand hygiene and includes
hand care assessment, staff education, Occupational Health assessment if skin integrity is an issue,
provision of hand moisturizing products and provision of alcohol-based hand rub that contains an
emollient. For more information about implementing a hand care program, refer to PIDAC’s Best
Practices for Hand Hygiene in All Health Care Settings, available at: http://www.oahpp.ca/resources/pidac-
knowledge/best-practice-manuals/hand-hygiene.html.
Hand Hygiene: A general term referring to any action of hand cleaning. Hand hygiene relates to the removal
of visible soil and removal or killing of transient microorganisms from the hands. Hand hygiene may be
accomplished using soap and running water or an alcohol-based hand rub. Hand hygiene includes surgical
hand antisepsis.
Hand Washing: The physical removal of microorganisms from the hands using soap (plain or
antimicrobial) and running water.
Health Care-Associated Infection (HAI): A term relating to an infection that is acquired during the
delivery of health care (also known as nosocomial infection).
Health Care Environment: People and items which make up the care environment (e.g., objects,
medical equipment, staff, clients/patients/residents) of a hospital, clinic or ambulatory setting, outside
the immediate environment of the client/patient/resident. See also, Environment of the
Client/Patient/Resident.

Preamble
About This Document
This document outlines the practice of Routine Practices and Additional Precautions (RP/AP) in health care
settings across the continuum of care (see below) including, but not limited to, pre-hospital care, acute care,
complex continuing care, rehabilitation facilities, long-term care, chronic care, ambulatory care and home
health care.
The goal of Routine Practices and Additional Precautions is to reduce the risk of transmission of
microorganisms in health care settings through:
understanding the concepts of the chain of transmission
understanding the concepts and application of Routine Practices (RP)

Assumptions and Best Practices for Infection Prevention and Control
The best practices in this document are based on the assumption that health care settings in Ontario
already have basic infection prevention and control (IPAC) systems in place.11 These settings should
work with organizations that have IPAC expertise, such as academic health science centres, regional
infection control networks (RICN), public health units that have professional staff certified in IPAC and
local IPAC associations (e.g., Community and Hospital Infection Control Association (CHICA) – Canada
chapters), to develop evidence-based programs.
In addition to the above general assumption about basic IPAC, these best practices are based on the
following additional assumptions and principles:
1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Adequate resources are devoted to IPAC in all health care settings. See PIDAC’s Best Practices for
Infection Prevention and Control Programs in Ontario,
11 available from the Public Health Ontario
(PHO) website at: http://www.oahpp.ca/resources/pidac-knowledge/best-practice-manuals/infection-prevention-
and-control-programs-in-ontario.html.
Programs are in place in all health care settings that promote good hand hygiene practices and
ensure adherence to standards for hand hygiene. See:
a) b) PIDAC’s Best Practices for Hand Hygiene in All Health Care Settings,

website at: http://www.oahpp.ca/resources/pidac-knowledge/best-practice-manuals/hand-hygiene.html.
Ontario’s hand hygiene improvement program, Just Clean Your Hands, available at:
http://www.oahpp.ca/services/jcyh/.
Adequate resources are devoted to Environmental Services/Housekeeping in all health care settings
that include written procedures for cleaning and disinfection of client/patient/resident rooms and
equipment; education of new cleaning staff and continuing education of all cleaning staff; and
ongoing review of procedures. See Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning in All Health Care
Settings,
10 available from the PHO website at: http://www.oahpp.ca/resources/pidac-knowledge/best-practice-
manuals/environmental-cleaning-for-prevention-and-control-of-infections.html.
Programs are in place in all health care settings that ensure effective disinfection and sterilization of
used medical equipment according to Best Practices for Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in
All Health Care Settings,
13 available from the PHO website at: http://www.oahpp.ca/resources/pidac-
knowledge/best-practice-manuals/cleaning-disinfection-and-sterilization.html.
Regular education (including orientation and continuing education) and support is provided
in all health care settings to help staff consistently implement appropriate IPAC practices.
Effective education programs emphasize:
the risks associated with infectious diseases, including acute respiratory illness and
gastroenteritis
hand hygiene, including the use of alcohol-based hand rubs and hand washing
principles and components of Routine Practices as well as additional transmission-based
precautions (Additional Precautions)
assessment of the risk of infection transmission and the appropriate use of personal
protective equipment (PPE), including safe application, removal and disposal

appropriate cleaning and/or disinfection of health care equipment, supplies and surfaces or
items in the health care environment
individual staff responsibility for keeping clients/patients/residents, themselves and co-
workers safe
collaboration between professionals involved in occupational health and IPAC.
NOTE: Education programs should be flexible enough to meet the diverse needs of the range of
health care providers and other staff who work in the health care setting. The local public health
unit and regional infection control networks may be a resource and can provide assistance in
developing and providing education programs for community settings.
6. Collaboration between professionals involved in occupational health and IPAC is promoted in all
health care settings, to implement and maintain appropriate IPAC standards that protect workers.
7. There are effective working relationships between the health care setting and local public health.
Clear lines of communication are maintained and public health is contacted for information and
advice as required. The obligations (under the Health Protection and Promotion Act, R.S.O. 1990,
c.H.714) to report reportable and communicable diseases is fulfilled. Public health provides regular
aggregate reports of outbreaks of reportable diseases in facilities and/or in the community to all
health care settings.
8. Access to ongoing IPAC advice and guidance to support staff and resolve differences is available to
the health care setting.
9. There are established procedures for receiving and responding appropriately to all international,
national, regional and local health advisories in all health care settings. Health advisories are
communicated promptly to all affected staff and regular updates are provided. Current advisories
are available from local public health units, the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (MOHLTC),
Health Canada and Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC)websites and local RICN.
10. Where applicable, there is a process for evaluating PPE in the health care setting, to ensure it
meets quality standards.
11. There is regular assessment of the effectiveness of the IPAC program and its impact on practices in
the health care setting. The information is used to further refine the program.11
Occupational Health and Safety requirements shall be met:
Health care facilities are required to comply with applicable provisions of the Occupational
Health and Safety Act (OHSA), R.S.O. 1990, c.0.1 and its Regulations.15 Employers, supervisors
and workers have rights, duties and obligations under the OHSA. Specific requirements under
the OHSA and its regulations are available at:
Occupational Health and Safety Act: http://www.e-
laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90o01_e.htm
Ontario Regulation 67/93 Health care and Residential Facilities: http://www.e-
laws.gov.on.ca/html/regs/english/elaws_regs_930067_e.htm
The Occupational Health and Safety Act places duties on many different categories of individuals
associated with workplaces, such as employers, constructors, supervisors, owners, suppliers,
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 xv
licensees, officers of a corporation and workers. A guide to the requirements of the Occupational
Health and Safety Act may be found at: http://www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/hs/pubs/ohsa/index.php.
The OHSA section 25(2)(h), the ‘general duty clause’, requires an employer to take every
precaution reasonable in the circumstances for the protection of a worker.
Specific requirements for certain health care and residential facilities may be found in the
Regulation for Health Care and Residential Facilities, available at: http://www.e-
laws.gov.on.ca/html/regs/english/elaws_regs_930067_e.htm. Under that regulation there are a number of
requirements, including:
Requirements for an employer to establish written measures and procedures for the health and
safety of workers, in consultation with the joint health and safety committee or health and
safety representative, if any. Such measures and procedures may include, but are not limited to,
the following:
 safe work practices
 safe working conditions
 proper hygiene practices and the use of hygiene facilities
 the control of infections
 immunization and inoculation against infectious diseases.
The requirement that at least once a year the measures and procedures for the health and
safety of workers shall be reviewed and revised in the light of current knowledge and
practice.
A requirement that the employer, in consultation with the joint health and safety committee
or health and safety representative, if any, shall develop, establish and provide training and
educational programs in health and safety measures and procedures for workers that are
relevant to the workers’ work.
A worker who is required by his or her employer or by the Regulation for Health Care and
Residential Facilities to wear or use any protective clothing, equipment or device shall be
instructed and trained in its care, use and limitations before wearing or using it for the first
time and at regular intervals thereafter and the worker shall participate in such instruction
and training.
The employer is reminded of the need to be able to demonstrate training, and is therefore
encouraged to document the workers trained, the dates training was conducted, and the
information and materials covered during training.
Under the Occupational Health and Safety Act, a worker must work in compliance with the Act
and its regulations, and use or wear any equipment, protective devices or clothing required by
the employer.
The Needle Safety Regulation (O.Reg 474/07) has requirements related to the use of hollow-
bore needles that are safety-engineered needles. The regulation is available at: http://www.e-
laws.gov.on.ca/html/regs/english/elaws_regs_070474_e.htm.

Routine Practices and Additional
Precautions in All Health Care Settings
Terms used in this document (see glossary for details and examples)
Health Care Provider: Any person delivering care to a client/patient/resident.
Staff: Anyone conducting activities within a health care setting (includes health care
providers).
Health Care Setting: Any location where health care is provided, including settings where
emergency care is provided, hospitals, complex continuing care, rehabilitation
hospitals, long-term care homes, mental health facilities, outpatient clinics,
community health centres and clinics, physician offices, dental offices, offices
of other health professionals and home health care.
1. Basic Principles
A. Mechanisms of Transmission of Microorganisms in Health Care Settings:
The ‘Chain of Transmission’
The transmission of microorganisms and
subsequent infection within a health care
setting may be represented by a ‘chain’,
with each link in the chain representing a
factor related to the spread of
microorganisms. Transmission does not
take place unless all six of the elements in
the chain of transmission are present
(Figure 1).
Transmission occurs when the
agent, in the reservoir, exits the
reservoir through a portal of exit,
travels via a mode of transmission
and gains entry through a portal of
entry to a susceptible host.
Figure 1: The Chain of Transmission
By eliminating any of the six links through effective infection prevention and control measures, or
‘breaking the chain’, transmission does not occur (Figure 2).
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 1
Transmission may be
interrupted when:
 the agent is eliminated or
inactivated or cannot exit
the reservoir
 portals of exit are
contained through safe
practices
 transmission between
objects or people does not
occur due to barriers
and/or safe practices
 portals of entry are
protected
 hosts are not susceptible
Figure 2: Breaking the Chain of Transmission
B. Principles of Routine Practices and Rationale
Routine Practices are based on the premise that all clients/patients/residents are potentially infectious,
even when asymptomatic, and that the same safe standards of practice should be used routinely with
all clients/patients/residents to prevent exposure to blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, mucous
membranes, non-intact skin or soiled items and to prevent the spread of microorganisms.
The consistent and appropriate use of Routine Practices by all health care providers with all patient
encounters will lessen microbial transmission in the health care setting and reduce the need for
Additional Precautions.
The risk of transmission of microorganisms involves factors related to the microbe, the source
client/patient/resident, the health care environment and the new host.8
Health care providers must assess the risk of exposure to blood, body fluids and non-intact skin and
identify the strategies that will decrease exposure risk and prevent the transmission of microorganisms.
This risk assessment followed by the implementation of Routine Practices to reduce or remove risk
should be incorporated into the culture of each health care setting and into the daily practice of each
health care provider. The goals of Routine Practices are listed in Figure 3.
Health care providers must assess the risk of exposure to blood, body fluids and non-intact skin and
identify the strategies that will decrease exposure risk and prevent the transmission of
microorganisms.

Figure 3: Goals of Routine Practices
C. Principles of Additional Precautions and Rationale
Additional Precautions are used in addition to Routine Practices for clients/patients/residents known or
suspected to be infected or colonized with certain microorganisms to interrupt transmission. Refer to
Appendix N, Clinical Syndromes/ Conditions with Required Level of Precautions, for a list of
microorganisms/diseases that require Additional Precautions.
Additional Precautions include the use of barriers, PPE and control of the environment that are put in
place for encounters with the client/patient/resident or their immediate environment. In some
instances, specialized engineering controls may be required (e.g., airborne infection isolation room for a
patient with tuberculosis) or enhanced cleaning protocols for the client/patient/resident environment
(e.g., Clostridium difficile – C. difficile, vancomycin-resistant enterococci - VRE).
The application of Additional Precautions may differ depending on the health care setting and the needs
of the client/patient/resident, particularly in long-term care and the community. More information
about Additional Precautions is available in Section 2.B.
Staff in all health care settings must follow Routine Practices and Additional Precautions and facilities
must implement a program that includes:
written policies and procedures that include risk assessment
staff education and training in indications and techniques for Routine Practices and
Additional Precautions, including hand hygiene
a program to measure compliance with Routine Practices and Additional Precautions,
including hand hygiene
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 3
sufficient and easily accessible PPE (e.g., gloves, masks, eye protection, gowns) available for
health care providers and other staff who are exposed to blood and body substances, with
education and training in their use
healthy workplace policies including a sharps injury prevention program;16 staff
immunization program; requirement for staff to remain home if ill with an infection which
may be transmitted to clients/patients/residents or other staff; and promotion of
respiratory etiquette for clients/patients/residents and staff
control of the environment to reduce the risks of transmission of microorganisms.
Successful implementation of Routine Practices and Additional Precautions (RP/AP) requires the
support of senior administration. Figure 4 shows components required for the successful
implementation of Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in health care facilities.

D. Accountability of Health Care Providers and Health Care Organizations
Adherence to recommended IPAC practices decreases transmission of microorganisms in health care
settings.17-21 Despite this, there are numerous studies on the behaviour of health care providers that show
poor compliance with hand hygiene22-24 and the use of protective barriers,
25-27 placing both staff and
clients/patients/residents at risk.
Organizations have a responsibility to have systems in place with established procedures that enable
compliance with Hand Hygiene, Routine Practices and Additional Precautions. Both the employer and
the employee have duties under the Occupational Health and Safety Act15
:
‘An employer shall ensure that the equipment, materials and protective devices as prescribed are
provided’ [S. 25(1)(a)] and ‘the equipment, materials and protective devices provided by the
employer are maintained in good condition’ [S. 25(1)(b)];
‘A worker shall use or wear the equipment, protective devices or clothing that his employer
requires to be used or worn’ [S. 28(1)(b)] and ‘a worker shall report to his or her employer or
supervisor the absence of or defect in any equipment or protective device of which the worker is
aware and which may endanger himself, herself or another worker’ [S. 28(1)(c)].
Preventing transmission of microorganisms to other clients/patients/residents is a patient safety issue,
and preventing transmission to staff is an occupational health and safety issue. Health care providers
are accountable to practice safely in a manner that protects clients/patients/residents and themselves
by following established organizational IPAC policies and procedures.
The consistent and appropriate use of Routine Practices by all health care providers will lessen microbial
transmission in the health care setting and reduce the need for Additional Precautions.
2. Best Practices
A. Routine Practices
Routine Practices refer to infection prevention and control (IPAC) practices to be used with all
clients/patients/residents during all care, to prevent and control transmission of microorganisms in all
health care settings. Routine Practices must be incorporated into the culture of each health care setting
and into the daily practice of each health care provider to protect both the client/patient/resident and
health care provider.
Routine Practices must be incorporated into the culture of each health care setting and into the
daily practice of each health care provider to protect both clients/patients/residents and providers.
ELEMENTS THAT COMPRISE ROUTINE PRACTICES
The basic elements of Routine Practices are listed in Box 1 and include:
a) b) risk assessment of the client/patient/resident and the health care provider’s interaction with the
client/patient/resident;
hand hygiene to be performed with an alcohol-based hand rub or with soap and water before and
after contact with a client/patient/resident or their environment, before invasive/aseptic
procedures and after body fluid exposure risk;

ROUTINE PRACTICES FOR VISITORS
Although visitors are less likely to transmit infection in the health care setting than staff, they should
receive instruction regarding specific facility control measures before they visit a client/patient/resident,
to ensure compliance with established practices:
Visitors should not enter the health care setting if they are sick or unable to comply with hand
hygiene and other precautions that might be required.
Hand hygiene before and after visiting should be emphasized.
If PPE is required by the visitor, this should be accompanied by instruction in its correct
application, use and disposal.
Instructional materials may be provided to visitors on recommended hand hygiene and respiratory
etiquette practices.
RISK ASSESSMENT
The first step in the effective use of Routine Practices is to perform a risk assessment. A risk assessment
must be done before each interaction with a client/patient/resident or their environment in order to
determine which interventions are required to prevent transmission during the interaction,28 because
the client/patient/resident’s status can change.
The risk assessment process will be a dynamic one, based on continuing changes in information as
care progresses, thus must be done before each interaction with a client/patient/resident.
Assessing Risk of Transmission
The risk of transmission of microorganisms between individuals involves factors related to:
the client/patient/resident infection status (including colonization)
the characteristics of the client/patient/resident
the type of care activities to be performed
the resources available for control
the health care provider immune status.8
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 7
Table 1 lists factors affecting the risk of transmission of microorganisms in health care settings. The
health care provider must perform a risk assessment of each task or interaction that includes:
assessing the risk of:
contamination of skin or clothing by microorganisms in the client/patient/resident
environment
exposure to blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, tissues
exposure to non-intact skin
exposure to mucous membranes
exposure to contaminated equipment or surfaces
recognition of symptoms of infection (e.g., syndromic surveillance).18 See Box 9 for a list of
clinical syndromes requiring the use of PPE and other controls pending diagnosis.
Where there is a risk of transmission of infection based on the risk assessment, appropriate controls
must be put into place and appropriate PPE must be used to protect the health care provider, other staff
and clients/patients/residents at least until a definitive diagnosis may be made. For example:
If the client/patient/resident has uncontained diarrhea, PPE such as gloves and a gown should
be considered when changing the bed sheets, to prevent contamination of hands and clothing.
If the client/patient/resident is soiling the environment outside of the immediate bed area, a
single room is preferable to limit transmission to other clients/patients/residents.
Use avoidance procedures that minimize contact with droplets (e.g., sitting next to, rather than
in front of, a coughing client/patient/resident when taking a history or conducting an
examination).
 Refer to Appendix B, Performing a Risk Assessment Related to Routine Practices and Additional
Precautions, for more information related to risk assessment.

HAND HYGIENE
Hand hygiene is considered the most important and effective ipac measure to prevent the
spread of health care-associated infections. In order to implement a comprehensive hand
hygiene program in a health care facility, refer to:
 Ontario’s evidence-based Just Clean Your Hands hand hygiene improvement program for hospitals
and long-term care,29 available at: http://www.oahpp.ca/services/jcyh/.
 PIDAC’s Best Practices for Hand Hygiene in All Health Care Settings,
12 available on the PHO website
at: http://www.oahpp.ca/resources/pidac-knowledge/best-practice-manuals/hand-hygiene.html.
 The World Health Organization’s Clean Care is Safer Care hand hygiene campaign is available at:
http://www.who.int/gpsc/en/.
Hand Hygiene Program
A multifaceted, multidisciplinary, facility-wide hand hygiene program, which includes demonstrable
administrative leadership, education, champions and environmental enablers can be effective at
reducing the incidence of HAIs.19, 30
All health care settings must implement a comprehensive hand hygiene program that incorporates the
following elements11
:
the program is multifaceted and multidisciplinary to provide leadership and decision-making
hand hygiene agents are available at point-of-care in all health care settings
education is given to health care providers about when and how to clean their hands
there is a hand care program to maintain skin integrity, in collaboration with Occupational Health.
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 9
Health care facilities must also include11
:
senior and middle management support and commitment to make hand hygiene an
organizational priority and address non-compliance
environmental changes and system supports, including alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) at the
point-of-care and a hand care program
ongoing auditing and observation of hand hygiene practices, with feedback to health care
providers
client/patient/resident engagement
opinion leaders and champions modeling the right behaviour.
Alcohol-based Hand Rub (ABHR)
To make it possible for health care providers to clean their hands at the right time, ABHR or a hand hygiene
sink must be provided at the point-of-care, where busy health care providers can clean their hands without
leaving the client/patient/resident.31 ABHRs are the preferred method to routinely decontaminate hands in
clinical situations when hands are not visibly soiled as they provide for a rapid kill of most transient
microorganisms, are less time-consuming than washing with soap and water and are easier on skin.19, 32-35
PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE)
PPE is used to prevent transmission of infectious agents from patient-to-staff. The same
equipment will also prevent transmission from patient-to-patient, staff-to-patient and staff-
to-staff.
PPE is used alone or in combination to prevent exposure, by placing a barrier between the infectious
source and one’s own mucous membranes, airways, skin and clothing.8, 18 The selection of PPE is based
on the nature of the interaction with the client/patient/resident and/or the likely mode(s) of
transmission of infectious agents. Selection of the appropriate PPE is based on the risk assessment (e.g.,
interaction, status of client/patient/resident) that dictates what is worn to break the chain of
transmission. For more information about risk assessment, see Section 2.A., Risk Assessment, and
Appendix B, Performing a Risk Assessment Related to Routine Practices and Additional Precautions.
PPE should never be used indiscriminately and overuse may have negative impacts, such as:
interference with quality of client/patient/resident care36, 37 (see also Section 2.B, Impact of
Isolation on Quality of Care)
waste and increased cost
staff may be less likely to wash their hands when wearing gloves for routine tasks
shortages of PPE that result in inappropriate use (e.g., re-use of gloves and gowns), leading to
increased transmission of microorganisms38, 39
environmental concerns relating to disposable PPE, washing agents and chemicals.
PPE should be put on just prior to the interaction with the client/patient/resident. When the interaction
for which the PPE was used has ended, PPE should be removed immediately and disposed of in the
appropriate receptacle. The process of PPE removal requires strict adherence to a formal protocol to
prevent recontamination.40 Refer to Appendix L, Recommended Steps for Putting On and Taking Off
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), for instructions for putting on and taking off PPE.
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 10
BOX 2: Appropriate Glove Use
Health care settings must ensure that staff have sufficient supplies of, and quick, easy access to, the PPE
required. Health care settings should have a process for evaluating PPE to ensure it meets quality
standards where applicable,6 including a respiratory protection program compliant with the Ministry of
Labour requirements.6, 11
Education in the proper use of PPE must be provided by the health care setting to all health care
providers and other staff who have the potential to be exposed to blood and body fluids.
Gloves
Gloves must be worn when it is anticipated that the hands will be in contact with mucous
membranes, non-intact skin, tissue, blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, or equipment and
environmental surfaces contaminated with the above.8
Gloves are not required for routine health care activities in
which contact is limited to intact skin of the
client/patient/resident (e.g., taking blood pressure, bathing
and dressing the client/patient/resident). Compliance with
hand hygiene should always be the first consideration.
Indiscriminate or improper glove use has been linked to
transmission of pathogens.41 Gloves are task-specific and
single-use for the task. Re-use of gloves has been associated
with transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA) and Gram-negative bacilli.42, 43
See Box 2 for the appropriate use of gloves.
Sterile gloves are used in operating theatres and when
performing sterile procedures such as central line insertions.
Selection of Gloves
It is important to assess and select the best glove for a given task.
Selection of gloves should be based on a risk assessment of 44
:
the type of setting (e.g., operating room,
environmental cleaning, laboratory)
the task that is to be performed (e.g., invasive or
non-invasive)
the likelihood of exposure to body substances
the anticipated length of use
the amount of stress on the glove.
 Select glove appropriate to task.
 Wear the correct size of gloves.
 Gloves should be put on
immediately before the activity for
which they are indicated.
 Clean hands before putting on
gloves for a clean/aseptic
procedure.
 Gloves must be removed and
discarded immediately after the
activity for which they were used.
 Hand hygiene must be performed
immediately after glove removal.
 Change or remove gloves if moving
from a contaminated body site to a
clean body site within the same
client/patient/resident.
 Change or remove gloves after
touching a contaminated site and
before touching a clean site or the
environment.
 Do not wash or re-use gloves.
 The same pair of gloves must not
be used for the care of more than
one client/patient/resident.
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 11
The barrier integrity of gloves varies on the basis of:
type and quality of glove material
intensity of use
length of time used
manufacturer
whether gloves were tested before or after use
method used to detect glove leaks.
It is preferable to provide more than one type of glove to health care providers, because it allows the
individual to select the type that best suits his/her care activities18. Some additional points to consider:
good quality vinyl gloves are generally sufficient for most tasks
latex or synthetic gloves, such as nitrile or neoprene gloves, are preferable for clinical
procedures that require manual dexterity and/or will involve more than brief patient contact18
powdered latex gloves have been associated with latex allergy
new types of latex gloves are being developed which may be safe for those with an allergy to
rubber latex45
gloves that fit snugly around the wrist are preferred for use with a gown because they will cover
the gown cuff and provide a better barrier for the arms, wrists and hands.18
 Refer to Appendix M, Advantages and Disadvantages of PPE, for advantages and disadvantages of
different types of medical gloves.
 For more information about standards for gloves, visit the Canadian General Standards Board
website at: http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/ongc-cgsb/programme-
program/certification/prog/gants-medical-eng.html.
Gloves and Hand Hygiene
Because gloves are not completely free of leaks and hands may become contaminated when removing
gloves,5 hands must be cleaned before putting on gloves for an aseptic/clean procedure and after glove
removal.8 Gloves must be removed immediately and discarded into a waste receptacle after the activity
for which they were used and before exiting a client/patient/resident environment.
Gloves may be adversely affected by petroleum-based hand lotions or creams. Verify with the glove
manufacturer that the gloves are compatible with the hand hygiene products in use in the health care
setting (e.g., lotions).
To reduce hand irritation related to gloves12
:
wear gloves for as short a time as possible
ensure hands are clean and dry before putting on gloves
ensure gloves are intact and clean and dry inside.
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 12
Gowns
A gown is worn when it is anticipated that a procedure or care activity is likely to generate splashes or
sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions, or excretions.
8
Long-sleeved gowns protect the forearms and clothing of the health care provider from splashing and
soiling with blood, body fluids and other potentially infectious material.
 See Box 3 for the appropriate use of gowns.
Selection of Gowns
The type of gown selected is based on the nature of the interaction with the client/patient/resident,
including18
:
anticipated degree of contact with infectious material
potential for blood and body fluid penetration of the gown (e.g., water-resistant gowns should
be used in the operating theatre when soaking is anticipated)
requirement for sterility (e.g., sterile gowns are worn in operating theatres and when performing
sterile procedures such as central line insertions).
Gowns used as PPE should be cuffed and long-sleeved, and offer full coverage of the body front, from
neck to mid-thigh or below. Clinical and laboratory coats or jackets are not a substitute for gowns where
a gown is indicated. Several gown sizes should be available in a health care setting to ensure appropriate
coverage for staff.
BOX 3: Appropriate Gown Use
 Gowns should only be worn when providing care for clients/patients/residents.
 When use of a gown is indicated, the gown should be put on immediately before the task and
must be worn properly, i.e., tied at top and around the waist.
 Remove gown immediately after the task for which it has been used in a manner that prevents
contamination of clothing or skin and prevents agitation of the gown.
 Discard used gown immediately after removal into appropriate receptacle. Do not hang gowns
for later use.
 Do not re-use gown. Do not go from patient-to-patient wearing the same gown.
Masks
A mask is used by a health care provider (in addition to eye protection) to protect the mucous
membranes of the nose and mouth when it is anticipated that a procedure or care activity is likely to
generate splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions or excretions,
8, 46 or within two metres of
a coughing client/patient/resident.18, 47
Masks are also required in operating theatres48 and when performing aseptic procedures (e.g.,
central line insertions,49, 50 spinal epidural/myelogram procedures51-54).
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 13
A mask should be placed on a coughing client/patient/resident when outside his/her room,
if tolerated, to limit dissemination of infectious respiratory secretions.18, 55, 56, 57
A mask should be worn for wound irrigation procedures if there is any risk of sprays or
splashes.
58
 See Box 4 for the appropriate use of masks.
Selection of Masks
Mask selection is based on a risk assessment that includes:
type of procedure/care activity
length of procedure/care activity
likelihood of contact with droplets/aerosols generated by the procedure or interaction.
Criteria for selecting masks include:
mask should securely cover the nose and mouth
mask should be substantial enough to prevent droplet penetration
mask should be able to perform for the duration of the activity for which the mask is indicated (e.g.,
surgery).
BOX 4: Appropriate Mask Use
 Select a mask appropriate to the activity
 Mask should securely cover the nose and mouth
 Change mask if it becomes wet.
 Do not touch mask while wearing it.
 Remove mask correctly immediately after completion of task and discard into an appropriate
waste receptacle.
 Do not allow mask to hang or dangle around the neck.
 Clean hands after removing the mask.
 Do not re-use disposable masks.
 Do not fold the mask or put it in a pocket for later use.
N95 Respirators
An N95 respirator is used to prevent inhalation of small particles that may contain infectious agents
transmitted via the airborne route.18
N95 respirators should also be worn for aerosol-generating procedures that have been shown to expose
staff to undiagnosed tuberculosis, including:
sputum induction
diagnostic bronchoscopy
autopsy examination.
 See Section 2.B, Airborne Transmission and Airborne Precautions, for more information about N95
respirators and their indications.
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 14
 Refer to Appendix M, Advantages and Disadvantages of PPE, for advantages and disadvantages of
different types of masks and N95 respirators.
Eye Protection
Eye protection is used by health care providers (in addition to a mask) to protect the mucous
membranes of the eyes when it is anticipated that a procedure or care activity is likely to
generate splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions or excretions,8, 46, 59 or within two
metres of a coughing client/patient/resident.18, 47, 60 Eye protection should also be worn for
wound irrigation procedures if there is any risk of sprays or splashes.
58
BOX 5: Appropriate Use of Eye
Protection
 Eye protection should be used
whenever there is a potential for
splashes or sprays to the eyes,
such as operating room
procedures, labour and delivery
and wound irrigation.
 Eye protection must be removed
immediately after the task for
which it was used and discarded
into waste or placed in an
appropriate receptacle for
cleaning.
 Prescription eye glasses are not
acceptable as eye protection.
Eye protection includes:
safety glasses
safety goggles
face shields
visors attached to masks
Prescription eye glasses are not acceptable by themselves as
eye protection; they may be worn underneath face shields
and some types of protective eyewear.
Eye protection may be disposable or, if reusable, should be
cleaned prior to re-use. Due to the risk of contamination, it
is recommended that reusable eye protection be sent to a
central area for reprocessing after use.
Eye protection should be comfortable, not interfere with
visual acuity and fit securely. A health care setting may need
to provide several different types, styles and sizes of
protective eye equipment.18
 See Box 5 for the appropriate use of eye protection.
Selection of Eye Protection
The eye protection chosen for specific situations depends on:
the type of activity and risk of exposure
the circumstances of exposure (e.g., droplet exposure vs. sprays/splashes of fluid)
other PPE used
personal vision needs.
Criteria for selecting eye protection include:
eye protection must provide a barrier to splashes from the side
eye protection may be single-use disposable or washable before re-use
prescription eye glasses are not acceptable as eye protection.
 Refer to Appendix M, Advantages and Disadvantages of PPE, for advantages and disadvantages of
different types of eye protection.
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 15
Routine Practices for Procedures that Generate Droplets and/or Aerosols
Certain procedures may generate droplets/aerosols that may expose staff to respiratory pathogens and
are considered to be a potential risk for staff and others in the area. PPE (mask and either protective
eyewear or face shield) must be used by staff when within two metres of procedures generating
droplets/aerosols on any client/patient/resident, with or without symptoms of an acute respiratory
infection, to prevent deposition of droplets/aerosols on staff mucous membranes.2 See Box 6 for a list
of procedures that generate droplets/aerosols where transmission has been documented.
There is debate about whether other medical procedures generate droplets/aerosols, leading to
transmission of respiratory infection. For these procedures, to date, there is inconclusive or no
published literature documenting transmission. Examples of such procedures include:
nebulized therapies
high-frequency oscillatory ventilation
tracheostomy or tracheostomy care
chest physiotherapy
collection of nasopharyngeal swabs or nasopharyngeal aspirates
tube or needle thoracostomy.
For these procedures, use of PPE should be determined by risk assessment. Facial protection is also
required routinely for:
breaches to the integrity of a mechanical ventilation system (e.g., open suctioning, filter changes)
disposal of filters used in mechanical ventilation and cleaning/disposal of bags and filters.
All units and crash carts should be equipped with:
a manual resuscitation bag with hydrophobic submicron filter
in-line suction catheters
non-rebreather mask that allows filtration of exhaled gases
PPE (gloves, gowns, masks, eye protection).
BOX 6: Procedures Generating Droplets/Aerosols where Transmission Has Been Documented
 Endotracheal intubation, including during cardio-pulmonary resuscitation1
 Cardio-pulmonary resuscitation2
 Open airway suctioning
 Bronchoscopy*
 Surgery and autopsy
 Sputum induction*
 Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation for acute respiratory failure (CPAP, BiPAP3-5)
oxygen therapy3
 High flow * For diagnostic (but not therapeutic) bronchoscopy or sputum induction, wear an N95 respirator,
due to risk from undiagnosed TB
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 16
CONTROL OF THE ENVIRONMENT
Controlling the environment includes measures that are built into the infrastructure of the health care
setting that have been shown to reduce the risk of infection to staff and clients/patients/residents. This
includes administrative controls, such as:
appropriate accommodation and placement
patient care equipment that is in good repair
effective cleaning practices for equipment and the environment.
Engineering controls, such as dedicated hand washing sinks, point-of-care ABHR and sharps containers,
and sufficient air changes per hour appropriate to the care setting, are the preferred controls as they do
not depend on individual health care provider compliance.
Accommodation and Placement
Single rooms, with dedicated bathroom and sink, are preferred for placement of all
clients/patients/residents.61 Studies have shown a clear relationship between the use of single rooms and
reduced infection.62-64 However, most health care facilities do not have sufficient single rooms to
accommodate all clients/patients/residents, so some might be accommodated in multi-bed rooms, which
presents a risk for transmission of microorganisms. Clear protocols must be in place regarding patient
placement in order to minimize the transmission risk to others.
In health care settings that do not have sufficient single rooms available for all routine care, decisions
must be made regarding room assignments and selection of roommates based on:
route of transmission of the infectious agent (known or suspected)
client/patient/resident risk factors for transmission (e.g., hygiene, cognitive status)
risk factors for acquisition in other clients/patients/residents in the unit (e.g., compromised immunity)
availability of single rooms.
Decision-making regarding accommodation should include the questions listed in Box 7.
28
BOX 7: Questions to Ask When Determining Placement of Clients/Patients/Residents and their
Roommates
 Is the client/patient/resident soiling his/her environment because of poor hygiene practices,
uncontained drainage or incontinence?
 Does the client/patient/resident have an infection that might be transmitted to another
client/patient/resident?
 What is the condition of other clients/patients/residents in the unit?
 Does the client/patient/resident have an indwelling device (e.g., urinary catheter, central line,
feeding tube)?
 Does the client/patient/resident have non-intact skin?
 What is the susceptibility level of the client/patient/resident with respect to underlying
diseases, neutropenia, extremes of age?
 Is the client/patient/resident at risk for an antibiotic-resistant organism?
 Can the client/patient/resident follow directions on hygiene measures?
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 17
For clients/patients/residents who have a cough or other symptoms of an acute respiratory infection:
move out of waiting area to a separate area or room as soon as possible
if single room accommodation is unavailable, maintain a spatial separation of at least two
metres18 between the coughing client/patient/resident and others in the room and draw the
privacy curtain between beds
if there is a suspicion that the infection is transmitted via the airborne route, the
client/patient/resident must be moved into a single room, preferably with negative pressure
a mask and instruction in hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette should be provided to the
client/patient/resident
symptomatic clients/patients/residents should be assessed as soon as possible.
Environment and Equipment Cleaning
The physical environment of a health care setting can harbour many microorganisms that are capable of
causing infection in susceptible individuals. Maintaining a clean and safe health care environment is an
essential component of IPAC and is integral to the safety of clients/patients/residents and staff. 65-68
Numerous studies have shown that the inanimate health care environment harbours bacteria and viruses
that may be transferred to clients/patients/residents and equipment via the hands of health care
providers.69, 70 Some studies have shown that environmental strains of microorganisms are identical to those
of the client/patient/resident occupying the environmental space.71, 72 In some instances, health care-
associated infection outbreaks have been brought under control when the intensity of environmental
cleaning was increased.73, 74
Health care settings must devote adequate resources to Environmental Services/Housekeeping that
include10, 11, 18, 67
:
adequate human resources
availability of appropriate cleaning products
written policies and procedures for cleaning and disinfection of client/patient/resident rooms
and equipment that includes cleaning standards and frequencies
education and training of cleaning staff
procedures and increased capacity for outbreak management
ongoing review and monitoring of practices and procedures.
Policies and procedures should address the environmental aspects of areas when the role of the
environment may be a significant factor in the prevention of HAIs, such as:
cleaning and disinfection of non-critical equipment between clients/patients/residents,
including transport equipment10, 67, 75
minimum high-level disinfection of semi-critical and sterilization of critical medical equipment13, 67
daily and terminal cleaning of rooms
cleaning requirements for rooms that house clients/patients/residents with C.difficile or
vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE)67
management of linen and waste10, 67
cleaning in areas adjacent to construction activities10, 67 at the end of the day or at other times as
required to maintain cleanliness.
Environmental cleaning in the health care facility should be performed on a routine and consistent basis
to provide for a safe and sanitary environment.10, 67 Cleaning staff require education and training that
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 18
includes clear messaging regarding their role in the prevention of infections in their health care setting.
Cleaning practices in the health care setting must be audited and results reported back appropriately.11
Frequent audits of practice must be included as part of the organization’s responsibility to maintaining a
clean environment.10
Health care settings must review their cleaning and disinfection methods to ensure that they are
adequate for disinfection of contaminated surfaces. Cleaning and disinfecting products used in the
health care setting must be approved by IPAC and Occupational Health.13 Hospital-grade disinfectants
must have a drug identification number (DIN) from Health Canada to indicate approval for use in
Canada.44 Manufacturers’ recommendations for use and dilution must be followed.44, 67

Food Preparation, Dishware and Eating Utensils18
Dishware and eating utensils are effectively decontaminated in commercial dishwashers with hot water
and detergents. Reusable dishware and utensils may be used for all patients/residents including those
on Additional Precautions. Disposable dishes are not required.
All areas where food is prepared and dispensed, including kitchenettes on nursing units, must comply
with the requirements of the Health Protection and Promotion Act, R.R.O. 1990, Regulation 562, Food
Premises,
76 available at: http://www.search.e-laws.gov.on.ca/en/isysquery/9fc62366-9b1a-4382-8e17-
a0b20a399eb8/4/doc/?search=browseStatutes&context=#hit1.
Linen
Policies and procedures should address the collection, transport, handling, washing and drying of soiled
linen, including protection of staff and hand hygiene. Laundry regulations should be addressed if the
facility does its own laundry.10
 For detailed information about the management of laundry, refer to PIDAC’s Best Practices for
Environmental Cleaning in All Health Care Settings,
10 available at: http://www.oahpp.ca/resources/pidac-
knowledge/best-practice-manuals/environmental-cleaning-for-prevention-and-control-of-infections.html
Facilities for hand hygiene must be readily available in laundry areas. Laundry staff should protect
themselves from potential cross-infection from soiled linen by wearing appropriate protective
equipment, such as gloves and gowns or aprons, when handling soiled linens. Staff should clean their
hands whenever gloves are changed or removed.
Linen that is soiled with blood, body fluids, secretions or excretions should be handled using the same
precautions, regardless of whether the client/patient/resident is on Additional Precautions and
regardless of the source or health care setting.10, 44, 67 In particular:
bag or otherwise contain contaminated laundry at the site of collection
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 19
use leak-proof containment for laundry contaminated with blood or body substances (water-
soluble bags and ‘double-bagging’ are not recommended)
laundry carts or hampers used to collect or transport soiled linen need not be covered
linen bags should be tied securely and not over-filled.
Staff in health care areas need to be aware of sharps when placing soiled linen in bags; laundry staff are
at risk from contaminated sharps, instruments or broken glass that may be contained with linen in the
laundry bags. Laundry staff should be trained in procedures for safe handling of soiled linen and must be
offered immunization against hepatitis B.10, 44
Waste
Written policies and procedures for management of contaminated infectious waste from health care settings
must be developed based on provincial regulations and local bylaws and should address issues such as the
collection, storage, transport, handling and disposal of contaminated waste, including sharps and biomedical
waste.10
 For more information about waste management, refer to PIDAC’s Best Practices for Environmental
Cleaning in All Health Care Settings, available at: http://www.oahpp.ca/resources/pidac-knowledge/best-
practice-manuals/environmental-cleaning-for-prevention-and-control-of-infections.html.
Waste handlers should wear protective apparel appropriate to their risk (e.g., gloves, protective footwear).
Waste handlers who may be exposed to biomedical waste and/or sharps must be offered hepatitis B
immunization.
Engineering Controls
Engineering controls are physical or mechanical measures put in place to reduce the risk of infection to
staff or to clients/patients/residents. Where infection risks cannot be eliminated or substituted,
engineering controls are the preferred next choice for controlling the risk, because they are built into
the facility infrastructure and do not rely on individuals to implement them correctly.
Handling of Sharps
Sharps are devices that can cause occupational injury to staff. Some examples of sharps include needles,
lancets, blades and clinical glass. A sharps injury prevention program must be in place in all health care
settings.11, 16 This should include follow-up for exposure to bloodborne pathogens.77
Prevention of sharps injuries may be achieved by:
the use of safety-engineered needles and medical sharps (a legislated requirement in Ontario78)
the provision of puncture-resistant sharps containers at point-of-care (a legislated requirement in
Ontario79)
staff education regarding the risks associated with unsafe procedures, such as re-capping.
 For specific requirements under Ontario’s needle safety legislation see the Occupational Health and
Safety Act, O. Regulation 474/07, Needle Safety,78 available at:
http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/regs/english/elaws_regs_070474_e.htm.
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 20
Physical Barriers
Physical barriers can help to deflect potentially infectious droplets when an individual coughs or
sneezes. Physical barriers include:
curtains, e.g., between beds
room dividers, e.g., multibed rooms, reception areas
glass or Plexiglass® screens and windows, e.g., reception areas, ambulances
cough/sneeze guards, e.g., food service areas
Hand Hygiene Equipment
ABHR should be available for use at the point-of-care. Hand washing sinks should be dedicated for staff
and visitor hand hygiene and placed at convenient locations so that staff do not need to travel a long
distance to reach the sink.
See Section 2.A., Hand Hygiene, for more information relating to hand hygiene.
 For information about hand hygiene equipment and placement, refer to PIDAC’s Best Practices
for Hand Hygiene in All Health Care Settings, available at: http://www.oahpp.ca/resources/pidac-
knowledge/best-practice-manuals/hand-hygiene.html.
Heating, Ventilation and Air- Conditioning Systems (HVAC)
HVAC systems are used and monitored to control air flow and quality in health care settings. Effective
HVAC systems regulate:
the number of air changes i.e., how often the air is removed and replaced
the direction of air flow i.e., inward away from the door (negative pressure, such as
bronchoscopy suites, equipment reprocessing areas, airborne infection isolation rooms) or
outward toward the door (positive pressure, such as operating rooms, sterile supply areas, burn
units)
where the air is exhausted i.e., outside the building (e.g., laundry facilities, bathrooms, waste
holding areas, isolation rooms) or inside through filters.
There is a regulatory requirement to inspect the mechanical ventilation system (including airborne
infection isolation rooms) every six months to ensure it is in good condition.79 For more information:
 Health Care and Residential Facilities Regulation 67/93 under the Occupational Health and
Safety Act, available at: http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/regs/english/elaws_regs_930067_e.htm
ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS
Administrative controls are measures that the health care setting puts into place to protect staff and
clients/patients/residents from infection.
Staff Education and Training
IPAC education should be provided to all staff, especially those providing direct client/patient/resident
care, at the initiation of employment as part of their orientation and as ongoing continuing education on
a scheduled basis.11 IPAC education must span the entire health care setting and be directed to all who
work in that setting. Health care facilities should ensure that appropriate policies and procedures are in
place to ensure attendance at training/education in Routine Practices and Additional Precautions
(including hand hygiene) and that attendance is recorded and reported back to the manager to become
a part of the employee’s performance review.11, 80
Effective IPAC education programs should address11
:
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 21
disease transmission, the risks associated with infectious diseases and basic epidemiology of
health care-associated infections specific to the care setting
hand hygiene, including the use of alcohol-based hand rubs and hand washing12
principles and components of Routine Practices as well as Additional Precautions
assessment of the risk of exposure and the appropriate use and indications for PPE, including
safe application, removal and disposal
appropriate cleaning and/or disinfection of health care equipment, supplies and surfaces or
items in the health care environment10, 13
individual staff responsibility for keeping clients/patients/residents, themselves and co-workers safe
education in early problem or symptom recognition.
Education of Clients/Patients/Residents
Client/patient/resident teaching should include:
correct hand hygiene
basic hygiene practices that prevent the spread of microorganisms, such as respiratory etiquette
not sharing personal items.
Client/patient/resident education about any precautions that might be required is important, as it
involves them in this aspect of their care and leads to increased patient satisfaction.81 Infection Control
Professionals (ICPs) may assist staff in education of clients/patients/residents through developing
and/or reviewing informational materials pertaining to Routine Practices.
Respiratory Etiquette
Health care settings should reinforce with staff, clients/patients/residents and visitors the personal practices
that help prevent the spread of microorganisms that cause respiratory infections. These personal practices
include:
not visiting in a health care facility when ill with an acute respiratory infection
avoidance measures that minimize contact with droplets when coughing or sneezing, such as:
turning the head away from others
maintaining a two-metre separation from others47
covering the nose and mouth with tissue
immediate disposal of tissues into waste after use
immediate hand hygiene after disposal of tissues.
Healthy Workplace Policies
All health care settings should establish a clear expectation that staff do not come into work when ill
with symptoms that are of an infectious origin, and support this expectation with appropriate
attendance management policies.68 Staff carrying on activities in a health care setting who develop an
infectious illness may be subject to some work restrictions.
The Communicable Disease Surveillance Protocols from the Ontario Hospital Association (OHA)/Ontario
Medical Association (OMA)/MOHLTC state: ‘Health care workers have a responsibility to their patients
and colleagues regarding not working when ill with symptoms that are likely attributable to an infectious
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 22
disease. This includes staff with influenza-like illness, acute respiratory infection, gastroenteritis and
conjunctivitis’.82
Immunization
Client/Patient/Resident Immunization
One of the most effective preventive measures to protect clients/patients/residents and staff from
acquiring communicable diseases is immunization. All health care settings should have an age-
appropriate immunization program in place.11
Staff Immunization
Immunization programs are highly effective and are a critical component of the occupational health and
safety program.83, 84 Health care providers must be offered appropriate immunizations. Immunizations
should be based on requirements such as OHA/OMA/MOHLTC communicable disease surveillance
protocols77, 85-87 and be consistent with recommendations from the National Advisory Committee on
Immunization for health care providers.88 Appropriate vaccine use protects the health care provider,
colleagues and the client/patient/resident. Vaccines appropriate for susceptible health care providers
include:
annual influenza vaccine85
measles,87 mumps,89 rubella86 (MMR) vaccine
varicella90 vaccine
hepatitis B77 vaccine, which should be followed by serology to document immunity
acellular pertussis91 vaccine
meningococcal vaccine for medical laboratory technologists who handle live meningococcal
cultures92
tetanus/diphtheria88

Recommendations for Routine Practices
1. Incorporate the elements of Routine Practices into the culture of all health care settings and into
the daily practice of each health care provider during the care of all clients/patients/residents at
all times. [BII]
2. Provide instruction to visitors regarding specific facility control measures before they visit a
client/patient/resident, to ensure compliance with established practices. [BII]
3. Perform a risk assessment before each interaction with a client/patient/resident or their
environment in order to determine which interventions are required to prevent transmission
during the planned interaction. [BIII]
4. Choose client/patient/resident accommodation based on the risk assessment.
5. Choose personal protective equipment (PPE) based on the risk assessment.
6. Implement a comprehensive hand hygiene program that follows recommendations such as those
in PIDAC’s ‘Best Practices for Hand Hygiene in All Health Care Settings’.[AI]
7. Provide sufficient supplies of easily accessible PPE. [AIII]

21. Wear an N95 respirator to prevent inhalation of small particles that may contain infectious agents
transmitted via the airborne route. [AII]
22. Single rooms, with dedicated bathroom and sink, are preferred for placement of all
clients/patients/residents. [BII]
23. Provide clear protocols for determining options for patient placement and room sharing based on
a risk assessment if single rooms are limited. [BII]
24. Place clients/patients/residents who visibly soil the environment or for whom appropriate hygiene
cannot be maintained in single rooms with dedicated toileting facilities. [AIII]
25. Implement a sharps injury prevention program in all health care settings. [AII]
26. Implement appropriate policies and procedures to ensure staff attend training/education in
Routine Practices (including hand hygiene), with attendance recorded and reported back to the
manager to become a part of the employee’s performance review. [AII]
27. Implement a program that promotes respiratory etiquette to staff, clients/patients/residents and
visitors in the health care setting. [AII]
28. Ensure that there is a clear expectation that staff do not come into work when ill with symptoms
that are of an infectious origin, and this expectation is supported with appropriate attendance
management policies. [BII]
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 25
B. Additional Precautions
Additional Precautions refer to IPAC interventions (e.g., PPE, accommodation, additional environmental
cleaning) to be used in addition to Routine Practices to protect staff and clients/patients/residents by
interrupting transmission of suspected or identified infectious agents.
 Refer to Appendix N, Clinical Syndromes / Conditions with Required Level of Precautions, for
infectious diseases and agents that require Additional Precautions.
Additional Precautions are based on the mode of transmission (e.g., direct or indirect contact, airborne
or droplet). There are three categories of Additional Precautions: Contact Precautions, Droplet
Precautions and Airborne Precautions.
ELEMENTS THAT COMPRISE ADDITIONAL PRECAUTIONS
In addition to Routine Practices, the following elements comprise Additional Precautions:
Specialized Accommodation and Signage
Specialized accommodation and signage for clients/patients/residents on Additional Precautions
includes:
Accommodation:
In hospitals, a single room64 with private toileting facilities are highly recommended for
clients/patients/residents on Additional Precautions.
In some cases where clients/patients/residents are known to be infected with the same
microorganism, cohorting is acceptable.
In long-term care homes, spatial separation of residents within their bed space, dependant
on a risk assessment of the resident, is recommended.
Refer to Appendix C, Decision-Making Related to Accommodation and Additional
Precautions, for accommodation recommendations.
Signage specific to the type(s) of Additional Precautions should be posted:
A sign that lists the required precautions should be posted at the entrance to the
client/patient/resident’s room or bed space.
Signage should maintain privacy by indicating only the precautions that are required, not
information regarding the patient’s condition.
Refer to Appendices F-K for sample signage.
Specialized engineering controls may be required for some types of Additional Precautions, e.g.,
airborne infection isolation room for Airborne Precautions. See Section 2.B., Airborne Transmission
and Airborne Precautions, for information regarding engineering controls for airborne infection
isolation rooms.
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 26
PPE
PPE is standardized and specific to the type(s) of Additional Precautions that are in place, e.g., gloves are
required for entry to a Contact Precautions room regardless of the interactions that are to take place. If
the health care provider needs to leave the room, the PPE must be removed and discarded. Fresh PPE
must be worn if the health care provider re-enters the room.
Dedicated Equipment
Equipment must be dedicated to the client/patient/resident whenever possible. Equipment and
supplies that are required for the interaction should be assembled first and brought into the room after
PPE has been put on.
Additional Cleaning Measures
Additional cleaning measures may be required for the client/patient/resident environment.
 For more information about environmental cleaning in health care settings, refer to PIDAC’s Best
Practices for Environmental Cleaning in All Health Care Settings10
, available at:
http://www.oahpp.ca/resources/pidac-knowledge/best-practice-manuals/environmental-cleaning-for-prevention-and-
control-of-infections.html
Limited Transport Procedures
Transport of clients/patients/residents on Additional Precautions may be limited in some cases. The
following points must be considered:
Normal health care activities must be maintained despite Additional Precautions, to ensure
quality of care (e.g., ambulation as part of recovery from hip surgery).
Clients/patients/residents who are to be transported must be assessed to determine their risk of
transmission to others.
For some conditions, limit transport of the client/patient/resident unless medically necessary
(e.g., tuberculosis, influenza, norovirus).

Communication
Effective communication regarding Additional Precautions is essential when a client/patient/resident
goes to another department for testing, to another unit or to other health care settings/facilities. This
communication must include Emergency Medical Services (EMS) staff and other transport staff.
 See Box 8 for a summary of the elements that comprise Additional Precautions.
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 27
COHORTING
Cohorting can be used when single rooms are not available or during outbreak situations. Cohorting has
contributed to the control of a number of outbreaks93, 94 and should be considered when transmission is
documented and continues despite alternative interventions, and when available facilities and staffing
allow for the establishment of cohorting.95 Cohorting should never compromise infection control
practices and Additional Precautions must be applied individually for each client/patient/resident within
the cohort.
Cohorting consists of two components: client/patient/resident cohorting and staff cohorting. Patient
cohorting is applicable in acute care settings for control of transmission of microorganisms or outbreaks.
In long-term care homes, movement of residents to achieve geographical cohorting is not appropriate
because displacement of residents from their own rooms will often cause harm to the resident, e.g.,
anxiety, disorientation. Staff cohorting is applicable in all health care facilities.
Additional Precautions must be applied individually for each client/patient/resident within the
cohort
Client/Patient/Resident Cohorting
Client/patient/resident cohorting refers to:
the placement and care of individuals who are infected or colonized with the same
microorganism in the same room; OR
placing those who have been exposed together to limit risk of further transmission.
In long-term care homes, resident cohorting does not imply that a resident is moved out of his/her
room. Rather, those who already share a room or who share a bathroom and who are infected or
colonized with the same microorganism may be treated as a cohort.
Geographical cohorting refers to restricting patients who are infected or colonized with the same
microorganism to several rooms along a corridor or an entire clinical unit. Use of this practice can limit
transmission by segregating those who are infected or colonized to a specified area away from those
who are not.96
Care equipment must be dedicated or cleaned between use on patients/residents in the same room. A
fresh gown and gloves should be worn for the care of each individual client/patient/resident and should
not be worn between patients/residents within the cohort.
Care should be taken to assess patients/residents for the duration of colonization/infection. Because
some patients/residents may become free of an ARO over time, care should be taken during cohorting
to avoid re-exposure by avoiding placement of newly identified cases together with those who have a
longer history of acquisition, who may no longer be infected or colonized with the microorganism.
Staff Cohorting
Staff cohorting is the practice of assigning specified health care providers to care only for
clients/patients/residents known to be colonized or infected with the same microorganism. These
health care providers should not participate in the care of clients/patients/residents who are not
colonized or infected with that microorganism.
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 28
Staff cohorting can be used in addition to client/patient/resident and geographical cohorting by
assigning dedicated staff to care for either those patients/residents who are infected or colonized, or
those who are not. This practice can be used during outbreaks to reduce the potential for cross-infection
between clients/patients/residents by limiting the number of staff interacting with
clients/patients/residents.97-99 It can also be used to limit the number of health care providers exposed
to infected cases.97
ADDITIONAL PRECAUTIONS AND VISITORS
Visitors of clients/patients/residents on Additional Precautions in health care facilities:
should be kept to a minimum
must receive education regarding hand hygiene and the appropriate use of PPE as described
under Routine Practices
must wear the same PPE as health care providers if in contact with other
clients/patients/residents or providing direct care.
Clients/patients/residents and visitors must be informed about the reason for implementing Additional
Precautions and receive instruction regarding how to enter and leave the room safely when the
client/patient/resident is on Additional Precautions. This should include demonstration in putting on,
taking off and disposing of PPE as required, as well as hand hygiene.
INITIATION AND DISCONTINUATION OF ADDITIONAL PRECAUTIONS
When Additional Precautions are instituted, they are always used in addition to Routine Practices.
Initiation of Additional Precautions
Additional Precautions must be instituted as soon as symptoms suggestive of a transmissible infection
are noted, not only when a diagnosis is confirmed (see Table 2 for examples). Instituting Additional
Precautions should be initiated for patients known to have, or considered to be at high risk of being
colonized or infected with, antibiotic-resistant organisms (AROs) in accordance with the health care
setting’s policy. Initiation of AP should not wait until laboratory confirmation of status.
Each health care setting should have a policy authorizing any regulated health care professional to
initiate the appropriate Additional Precautions at the onset of symptoms and maintain precautions until
laboratory results are available to confirm or rule out the diagnosis. The person designated as the
Infection Control Professional (ICP) for the health care setting:
must be informed when Additional Precautions are initiated
will verify that the precautions are appropriate to the situation
will be consulted before discontinuation of Additional Precautions or according to health care setting
policy.

Duration and Discontinuation of Additional Precautions
The health care setting should have a policy that permits discontinuation of Additional Precautions in
consultation with the ICP or designate. The attending physician should be notified when Additional
Precautions are being discontinued. If there is disagreement between the ICP and the attending
physician regarding the discontinuation, then the higher level of precautions will remain in effect with
daily review until there is a definitive diagnosis or expert consultation.
Additional Precautions should remain in place until there is no longer a risk of transmission of the
microorganism or illness. In some instances expert consultation may be required.
Health care settings should have policies that authorize the Infection Prevention and Control
Professional to initiate and/or discontinue Additional Precautions.
Where the periods of communicability are known, precautions may be discontinued at the appropriate time.
 Refer to Appendix N, Clinical Syndromes/ Conditions with Required Level of Precautions, for
recommendations related to the duration of Additional Precautions for specific illnesses.

IMPACT OF ADDITIONAL PRECAUTIONS ON QUALITY OF CARE
Although Additional Precautions, such as wearing gloves and single room accommodation, are necessary
to protect both other clients/patients/residents and health care providers, there may also be negative
impacts for the client/patient/resident. 36, 37, 100-102
These include101
:
Limited contact with health care providers may result in lack of monitoring processes such as
recording of vital signs and physician visits,102 medication errors and increases in falls.
Fewer visits from family and friends often resulted in feelings of loneliness and interfered with
needed emotional support.
Psychological problems related to isolation such as anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance,
withdrawal, regression and hallucinations have been reported.103-109
Recent studies, however, have noted that patients on Contact Precautions did not perceive a negative
impact on their care,81, 110 and often perceived precautions as an improvement in their care.81 Some
patients valued the privacy and solitude afforded by Contact Precautions107 and the quietness and
privacy of single rooms.108 There is also evidence that single-room accommodation is associated with
improved outcomes, including a reduced risk of health care-acquired infection.
61
Psychological support for the client/patient/resident should include structured recreation programs,
steps to prevent time disorientation and psychological support for both clients/patients/residents and
their families.81, 101, 103, 108, 111-113
It is important that Additional Precautions not be used any longer than necessary and that frequent
assessment of the risks of transmission be carried out by ICPs with the goal being the removal of
precautions as soon as it is safe to do so. Modification of precautions may be required for medical
purposes (e.g., to permit specialized testing) or on compassionate grounds.
CONTACT TRANSMISSION AND CONTACT PRECAUTIONS
Contact Transmission
Contact transmission is the most common route of transmission of infectious agents. There are two
types of contact transmission (Figure 5):
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 31
Direct contact occurs through touching; for example, an individual may transmit microorganisms
to others by touching them.
Indirect contact occurs when microorganisms are transferred via contaminated objects; for
example, C. difficile might be transferred between patients, if a commode used by a patient with
C. difficile is taken to another patient without cleaning and disinfecting the commode in
between uses.
DIRECT CONTACT INDIRECT CONTACT
Figure 5: Contact transmission from hands (direct) or objects (indirect)
Microorganisms transmitted by contact transmission include many of the epidemiologically significant
microorganisms in health care settings (e.g., MRSA, VRE, ESBL, CPE, Clostridium difficile, multidrug-
resistant Acinetobacter baumannii) and the agents of infectious diarrheas.
Contact Precautions
Contact Precautions are used in addition to Routine Practices for microorganisms where contamination
of the environment or intact skin is a particular consideration, such as:
contamination of the client/patient/resident environment
infectious agents of very low infective dose (e.g., norovirus, rotavirus)
clients/patients/residents infected or colonized with epidemiologically important
microorganisms that may be transmitted by contact with intact skin or with contaminated
environmental surfaces (e.g., MRSA, VRE, C. difficile).8
Rationale for Contact Precautions
Contact Precautions have been shown to control outbreaks and to decrease transmission when Routine
Practices alone have failed to limit the spread of microorganisms spread by the contact route.
114-117
Several studies provide evidence that the appropriate use of gloves can help reduce transmission of
pathogens in health care settings.118-120 Gown use has been shown to be effective in the control of
epidemiologically important pathogens, such as VRE.69, 121-124
Elements that Comprise Contact Precautions
In addition to Routine Practices, the elements that comprise Contact Precautions are summarized in
Table 3.
Contact Precautions are always in addition to Routine Practices such as hand hygiene. Ensure hand
hygiene by the patient on leaving his/her room. Clients/patients/residents should be encouraged to
perform hand hygiene on arrival in, and departure from, an ambulatory/clinic setting.
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 32
Accommodation
Preferred accommodation in acute care for Contact Precautions is a single room with a dedicated toilet
and patient sink.8, 18 The door may remain open. If single rooms are unavailable,
clients/patients/residents may be cohorted with other clients/patients/residents who are infected with
the same microorganism.
In long-term care and other residential settings, placement of residents requiring Contact Precautions
should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.18 Infection risk to other occupants of the room must be
considered when selecting roommates.
In ambulatory settings, place patients who require Contact Precautions in an examination room or
cubicle as soon as possible.18
 Refer to Appendix C, Decision-Making Related to Accommodation and Additional Precautions, for a
guide to assist with the accommodation and placement of clients/patients/residents requiring
Contact Precautions.
PPE
In acute care, gloves must be worn on entering the patient’s room or bed space. Gloves must be
removed and hands cleaned on exit from the room or bed space.
In acute care, a gown must be worn if skin or clothing will come in contact with the patient or
the patient’s environment. For example:
a gown is required:
 in rooms of children who are incontinent or too immature to comply with hygiene
 in rooms of non-compliant adults who soil the environment
 in crowded rooms/bed spaces where there is a likelihood of coming into contact with
contaminated furnishings or equipment
 when providing direct care, such as physical examination,125 checking vital signs, bathing
or turning the patient, changing clothing, continence care, dressing changes, care of
open wounds.
a gown is not required:
 when delivering a food tray
 when doing a visual check of a patient at night
 when speaking to a patient without touching anything.
If a health care provider enters a Contact Precautions room without a gown and is then
required to perform an activity that requires a gown, he/she must remove and discard
gloves, clean hands, put on a gown and apply fresh gloves before returning to provide care.
In non-acute settings, gloves and gown are required for activities that involve direct care (see
Glossary) where the health care provider’s skin or clothing may come in direct contact with the
resident or items in the resident’s room or bed space. Gloves and gown, if worn, must be
removed and hands cleaned immediately following the activity for which they were used.
It is never appropriate for clients/patients/residents to wear gloves or isolation gowns while outside
their room.
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 33
Cleaning and Transport
Routine cleaning practices are acceptable for most rooms on Additional Precautions. Modified or
additional environmental cleaning procedures and transportation of clients/patients/residents with
AROs are important components of Contact Precautions for VRE and C. difficile.

DROPLET TRANSMISSION AND DROPLET PRECAUTIONS
Droplet Precautions are used in addition to Routine Practices for clients/patients/residents known or
suspected of having an infection that can be transmitted by large respiratory droplets.
Droplet Transmission
Droplet transmission occurs when droplets carrying an infectious agent exit the respiratory tract of a
person. Droplets can be generated when he or she talks, coughs or sneezes and through some
procedures performed on the respiratory tract (e.g., suctioning, bronchoscopy or nebulized therapies).
These droplets are propelled a short distance126 and may enter the host’s eyes, nose or mouth or fall
onto surfaces. For example, if a person is coughed on by someone who has an acute respiratory
infection and the secretions come in contact with mucous membranes, infection may be transmitted.
Recent work suggests that droplets forcibly expelled from a cough or sneeze travel for up to two metres
or more, depending on the amount of air turbulence in the immediate vicinity.126, 127 For patients who
cannot cough forcibly, the distance that droplets travel will be less, e.g., infants and frail elderly.
Droplets do not remain suspended in the air and usually travel less than two metres (Figure 6).127
Microorganisms contained in these droplets are then deposited on surfaces in the
client/patient/resident’s immediate environment and some microorganisms remain viable for extended
periods of time. Contact transmission can then occur by touching surfaces and objects contaminated
with respiratory droplets.8
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 35
Microorganisms transmitted by this route are of special concern in certain populations, e.g., paediatrics,
frail elderly, persons with cardiopulmonary disease.8 Examples of microorganisms transmitted by
droplet transmission include: respiratory tract viruses (e.g., adenovirus, influenza and parainfluenza
viruses, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus - RSV), rubella, mumps and
Bordetella pertussis.
Figure 6: Droplet transmission from coughing or sneezing
Elements that Comprise Droplet Precautions
In addition to Routine Practices, the elements that comprise Droplet Precautions are summarized in
Table 4.
Droplet Precautions are always in addition to Routine Practices such as hand hygiene. Ensure hand
hygiene by the patient on leaving his/her room. Clients/patients/residents must perform hand hygiene
on presentation and departure from an ambulatory/clinic setting.
Accommodation
Preferred accommodation for Droplet Precautions in acute care is a single room with a dedicated toilet
and patient sink, and door may remain open. In long-term care, residents should remain in their
room/bed space, if feasible, with privacy curtains drawn.
 Refer to Appendix C, Decision-Making Related to Accommodation and Additional Precautions, for a
guide to assist with the accommodation and placement of clients/patients/residents who require
Droplet Precautions.
PPE
A mask and eye protection60 must be worn by any individual who is within two metres of the
client/patient/resident on Droplet Precautions.
Transport
In most cases, transport should be limited unless required for diagnostic or therapeutic procedures, such
as ambulation. The client/patient/resident must wear a mask during transport, if tolerated.55 If the
client/patient/resident cannot tolerate wearing a mask, transport staff should wear a mask and eye
protection.
Visitors
Visitors should receive education regarding hand hygiene. A mask should be worn by visitors within two
meters of the client/patient/resident. For paediatrics, household contacts of children on Droplet
Precautions do not need to wear PPE, as they will have already been exposed in the household.

AIRBORNE TRANSMISSION AND AIRBORNE PRECAUTIONS
Airborne Precautions are used in addition to Routine Practices for clients/patients/residents known or
suspected of having an illness transmitted by the airborne route.8
Airborne Transmission
Airborne transmission occurs when airborne particles remain suspended in the air, travel on air currents
and are then inhaled by others who are nearby or who may be some distance away from the source
patient, in a different room or ward (depending on air currents) or in the same room that a patient has
left, if there have been insufficient air exchanges.8 Control of airborne transmission requires control of air
flow through special ventilation systems and the use of respirators.8 Microorganisms transmitted by the
airborne route are Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), varicella virus (chickenpox virus) and measles virus.
Effective control of airborne microorganisms hinges on maintaining a high degree of suspicion for those
who present with compatible symptoms of an airborne infection,128 early isolation in an appropriate
environment and rapid diagnosis. For measles and varicella, immunization is the primary means of
control.
Controls for preventing the transmission of airborne infections include:
immunity against measles and varicella
early identification of potential cases
prompt isolation in an airborne infection isolation room
appropriate treatment of client/patient/resident, where applicable
the use of a fit-tested, seal-checked N95 respirator, when indicated
identification and follow-up of exposed clients/patients/residents and staff.
Elements that Comprise Airborne Precautions
N95 Respirators
A fit-tested, seal-checked N95 respirator must be worn by all staff when entering the room,
transporting129 or caring for a client/patient/resident with signs and symptoms or a diagnosis of active
pulmonary or laryngeal tuberculosis. An N95 respirator must
also be worn if non-immune staff are required to enter the
room of a client/patient/resident with measles or varicella
when there are no qualified immune staff available and
patient safety would be compromised if care was not
provided.
N95 respirators must8
:
filter particles one micron in size
have a 95% filter efficiency
provide a tight facial seal with less than 10% leak.
BOX 10: Appropriate Use of N95
Respirators
 Select respirator for which you
have been fit-tested.
 Perform a seal-check each time a
respirator is applied.
 Change respirator if wet or soiled.
 Remove the respirator correctly
and discard on removal into an
appropriate receptacle.
 Perform hand hygiene after
removing the respirator.
 NEVER put an N95 respirator on a
client/patient/resident.
N95 respirator failure is primarily related to poor fit and
leakage around the face seal. Assuring a good fit through an
approved fit-testing program and performing a seal-check
each time a respirator is used are essential for full
protection.130-132 See Box 10 for the appropriate use of N95
respirators.
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 38
Health care settings that use respirators must have a respiratory protection program in place. See Section
2.C, Respiratory Protection Program, Fit-testing and Seal-checking, for more information.
In health care settings specializing in care for patients with active tuberculosis (e.g., TB hospitals or units),
staff may choose to re-use N95 respirators. If re-using a respirator it must be stored in a way that keeps it
clean, dry, not crushed or folded and not used by anyone else. If the N95 respirator was used for a
client/patient/resident who is also on Droplet or Contact Precautions, it must be discarded on removal and
not re-used.
Client/Patient/Resident Controls
Patients on Airborne Precautions should remain in the airborne infection isolation room unless required
to leave for medical reasons.
A mask is effective in trapping the large infectious particles expelled by coughing patients.55, 57
Clients/patients/residents suspected or confirmed to have an airborne infection are to wear a mask at
all times, if tolerated, when they must leave an area that has correct engineering controls (i.e., negative
pressure ventilation). If the patient is ventilated, a filter must be present on the expiratory circuit. There
is never an indication for a client/patient/resident to wear an N95 respirator.
Visitors
For TB:
Household contacts should be assessed for active tuberculosis prior to visiting the facility. A
respirator is not required, as they have already been exposed in the household.
Visitors other than household contacts should be discouraged from visiting. If visiting, they
should be counselled about their risk and wear an N95 respirator with good fit characteristics.
Instruction should be given on how to perform a seal-check.
130, 131
For varicella and measles:
Household contacts of patients with measles or varicella are not required to wear an N95
respirator when visiting, as they will already have been exposed in the household. They should
be assessed for active infection prior to visiting.
Visitors of patients with measles or varicella who are known to be immune do not need to wear
an N95 respirator to visit.
Non-household contacts that are not immune should not visit.
Specialized Accommodation for Airborne Precautions
For clients/patients/residents on Airborne Precautions, single room accommodation in an airborne infection
isolation room (AIIR) that has engineering controls in place consistent with standards from the Canadian
Standards Association (CSA) is required. If an AIIR is not available, transfer the patient to a facility with
appropriate accommodation as soon as medically feasible. See below for engineering controls required for AIIRs.
Recommended Engineering Controls for Reducing Transmission of Microorganisms Spread by the
Airborne Route
Engineering controls (e.g., directional negative pressure ventilation) are the most preferred and most
effective method of minimizing exposure to airborne infections and should be used in high risk areas.
Airborne infection isolation rooms must meet ventilation standards established by the Canadian
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 39
Standards Association133 and should meet the patient placement guidelines published by the Public
Health Agency of Canada (PHAC)8, 129 (see Boxes 11 and 12 for requirements).
At a minimum, the emergency room, bronchoscopy suites, critical care settings and autopsy suites must
have rooms with negative pressure capabilities as described above for high risk procedures. In acute
settings expected to care for patients with infectious pulmonary tuberculosis, measles, varicella or
disseminated zoster, a sufficient number of negative pressure rooms must be available on in-patient
units.
An assessment of the risk of exposure to airborne infections will assist in establishing the location and
number of airborne infection isolation rooms required in order to decrease the risk of exposure to
airborne infections in the health care setting.
If using a portable HEPA-filtration unit, the ventilation requirements for an airborne infection isolation
room as listed in Box 11 must be met.
In addition to Routine Practices, the elements that comprise Airborne Precautions are summarized in

BOX 11: Standards for Ventilation in Airborne Infection Isolation Rooms
Requirements for airborne infection isolation rooms are:
 ventilation creating inward directional airflow from adjacent spaces to the room (negative
pressure):
o monitor room on initiation of use
o monitor at least daily when in-use
o monitor monthly between uses
 an alarm indicating that the pressure relationship is not being maintained, provided just
outside the room and at the nurse’s station or point of supervision
 directional airflow within the room such that clean supply air flows first to parts of the room
where staff or visitors are likely to be present, and then flows across the bed area to the
exhaust
 nonaspirating diffusers
 low-level exhaust near the head of the bed
 air exhausted to the outdoors via dedicated exhaust:
o washroom exhausted using the same exhaust system as the room
o exhaust fan supplied by emergency power
 HEPA filtration of exhaust in cases where exhaust air is not discharged clear of building
openings or where a risk of recirculation exists
 minimum 12 air changes per hour (new facilities)
 minimum 3 outdoor air changes per hour
 frequent monitoring of supply and exhaust system function by staff trained in appropriate
assessment of the airflow; direction of air flow should be tested with smoke tubes at all
four corners of the door

BOX 12: Guidelines for Use of Airborne infection isolation Rooms
 In acute and long-term care settings the client/patient/resident is to be placed in an airborne
infection isolation room that meets the criteria set out by the Canadian Standards Association
(see Box 11).
 Room should have toilet, hand washing sink and bathing facilities. If air is exhausted from the
bathroom, leave bathroom door open when not in use.
 Door must be kept closed whether or not client/patient/resident is in the room.
 Windows must remain closed at all times; opening the window may cause reversal of air flow, an
effect that can vary according to wind direction and indoor/outdoor temperature differentials.
 Room door must remain closed and negative airflow maintained after client/patient/resident
discharge until all air in the room has been replaced; this will vary based on the number of room
air changes per hour; consult facility plant engineers to determine the air changes per hour for
each airborne infection isolation room (refer to Appendix D, Time Required for Airborne Infection
Isolation Room to Clear M. tuberculosis).
 A preventative maintenance program must be in place.
 If a long-term care setting does not have the appropriate facilities for airborne precautions, the
resident is to be transferred to a health care facility equipped to manage airborne infections; if
the transfer is delayed or not possible, place the resident in a single room with the door and
window closed.
 In ambulatory settings, clients with suspected airborne infection should not wait in a common
area but be placed directly into an examining room. Preferably this should be a negative
pressure room with exhaust vented to the outside or filtered through a high efficiency filter if
recirculated. If a well ventilated room is not available, a single room should be used and the
client examined and discharged as quickly as possible. The door must be closed.
 In aerosol-generating procedure rooms where patients with airborne infections are expected to
be seen (e.g., bronchoscopy suite, autopsy suite, rooms used for sputum inductions):
 there is to be a minimum of 12 air changes per hour in new facilities and a minimum of six
air changes per hour in existing facilities;
 the room must have inward directional air flow;
 the air is to be exhausted directly outside the building and away from intake ducts or
through a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, if recycled; and
 the Canadian Tuberculosis Standards recommend a minimum of 15 air changes per hour
for these rooms.

Infection in Health Care, 1999 [under revision] and the Public Health Agency of Canada’s Canadian
Tuberculosis Standards, 2007
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 43
COMBINATIONS OF ADDITIONAL PRECAUTIONS
Where more than one mode of transmission exists for a particular microorganism, the precautions
used must take into consideration both modes.
Most infectious agents have a primary mode of transmission but may also have a secondary mode of
transmission. Where more than one mode of transmission exists for a particular microorganism, the
precautions used must take into consideration both modes. For example, respiratory viruses may
remain viable for some time in droplets that have settled on objects in the immediate environment of
the client/patient/resident and may be picked up on the hands of patients or staff. These
microorganisms may be transmitted by contact as well as by droplet transmission and, therefore, both
Contact and Droplet Precautions are required.8, 18
If both tuberculosis and a respiratory virus are suspected in a single individual, a combination of
Airborne, Droplet and Contact Precautions should be used. In this case, the N95 respirator must be
discarded after each use and not re-used, as the outside of the respirator will be contaminated.
PROTECTIVE ENVIRONMENT
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of a protective environment (formerly known as
‘reverse isolation’) for most immunocompromised patients.
134-136 It is critical that health care providers
and others who are acutely ill with a communicable infection do not enter the room of
immunocompromised patients.
To prevent invasive fungal infections, some centres recommend that new allogeneic haematopoietic
stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients should be accommodated in a single room with positive pressure
ventilation relative to the corridor; HEPA filtration of incoming air; sealed rooms to prevent flow of air
from the outside; and ventilation to provide ≥ 12 air changes per hour.18, 137, 138

Recommendations for Additional Precautions
29. Incorporate the elements of Additional Precautions into the health care practices of each health
care setting. [BII]
30. Ensure appropriate policies and procedures are in place to require staff attendance at
training/education in Additional Precautions, with attendance recorded and reported back to the
manager to become a part of the employee’s performance review. [AII]
31. When single patient rooms are limited, determine the feasibility of cohorting patients who are
infected or colonized with the same microorganism. [BIII]
32. Consider the use of geographic cohorting patients and staff to reduce transmission during
outbreaks. [AII]
33. When cohorting, apply Additional Precautions individually for each client/patient/resident within
the cohort. Do not wear the same gowns and gloves when going from patient-to-patient within
the cohort and do not share patient care equipment. [AII]
34. Provide PPE to visitors to clients/patients/residents on Additional Precautions if they will be in
direct contact with clients/patients/residents or are providing direct care. [BIII]
35. In all health care settings, implement a policy authorizing any regulated health care professional
to initiate the appropriate Additional Precautions at the onset of symptoms. [BII]
36. Continue Additional Precautions until there is no longer a risk of transmission of the
microorganism or illness. [AII]
37. Implement a policy that permits discontinuation of Additional Precautions in consultation with the
Infection Prevention and Control Professional (ICP) or designate. [BIII]
38. Do not use Additional Precautions any longer than necessary. Ongoing assessment of the risk of
transmission should be performed by ICPs.[AII]
39. In acute care, place patients who require Contact Precautions in a single room with dedicated
toilet and patient sink when available. [AII]
40. In long-term care and other residential settings, place residents who require Contact Precautions
as determined on a case-by-case basis using a risk assessment. [BII]
41. In ambulatory settings, place patients who require Contact Precautions in an examination room or
cubicle as soon as possible. [BII]
42. In acute care, for Contact Precautions wear gloves for all activities in the patient’s room or bed
space. Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene immediately on leaving the room or bed space.
[AII]
43. In acute care, for Contact Precautions wear a gown for all activities where skin or clothing will
come in contact with the patient or the patient’s environment. When indicated, put on gown on
entry to the patient’s room or bed space. If used, remove gown and perform hand hygiene
immediately on leaving the room or bed space. [BIII]
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 45
44. In non-acute settings, for Contact Precautions wear gloves and a gown for activities that involve
direct care. Remove gloves and gown, if worn, and perform hand hygiene immediately on leaving
the room. [AII]
45. Whenever possible, dedicate equipment and items to the client/patient/resident on Contact
Precautions. [AII]
46. In acute care, place patients who require Droplet Precautions in a single room with dedicated
toilet and patient sink, when available. [AII]
47. In long-term care and other residential settings, ensure residents who require Droplet Precautions
remain in their room or bed space, if feasible. [AII]

symptomatic client/patient away from waiting area to a single room as soon as possible, or
maintain a two-metre spatial separation. [AII]
49. Wear a mask and eye protection within two metres of a client/patient/resident on Droplet
Precautions. [BII]
50. Provide a mask to clients/patients/residents on Droplet Precautions for transport or ambulation
outside of the room, if tolerated. [BIII]
51. Move clients/patients/residents who require Airborne Precautions to an airborne infection
isolation room as soon as possible. [AII]
52. Restrict client/patient/resident on Airborne Precautions to his/her room with the door closed,

53. Wear an N95 respirator when entering an airborne infection isolation room when it is being used
for tuberculosis. [AII]
54. Do not enter the room of a patient with measles, varicella or zoster unless immune. [AIII]
55. Provide a mask to clients/patients/residents on Airborne Precautions during transport or activities
outside their room, if tolerated. [BIII]
56. Wear an N95 respirator during transport of clients/patients/residents on Airborne Precautions. [CIII]
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 46
C. Occupational Health and Hygiene Issues
Adherence of health care providers to recommended IPAC practices will decrease the transmission of
infectious agents in health care settings.19 All health care providers have a responsibility to know their
immunization status (see Section 2.A, Immunization); to adhere to Routine Practices and Additional
Precautions (including appropriate and correct use of PPE and hand hygiene); to use sharps safely (see
Section 2.A, Handling of Sharps ); and to report exposures and infections that put themselves at risk for
transmission of infections.
Staff who consume food or beverages in care areas (client/patient/resident environment, nursing station,
charting areas) are at increased risk for acquiring serious foodborne gastrointestinal infections. Institutional
outbreaks involving staff have been reported, particularly with hepatitis A,
139-144 cryptosporidiosis145 and
norovirus.146
POST-EXPOSURE FOLLOW-UP
The effective management of staff exposures requires the cooperation of both Occupational Health and
IPAC staff. Occupational health policies and procedures should address post-exposure follow-up and
prophylaxis when indicated.77 There should be a program to deal with staff exposures that includes11
:
identification of exposed staff
assessment and immunization history
post-exposure prophylaxis and follow-up including:
collection and analysis of exposures
a program for prompt response to sharps injuries16, 77
policies to deal with spills and staff exposure to blood or body fluids
education regarding preventive actions that may be put into place to improve practices and
prevent recurrence.
RESPIRATORY PROTECTION PROGRAM, FIT-TESTING AND SEAL-CHECKING
A respiratory protection program is required for staff who will be required to wear an N95 respirator
(Ministry of Labour requirement). The program must include:
a health assessment
N95 respirator fit-testing
training – health care providers and other staff required to wear an N95 respirator must be
educated regarding the proper way to perform a seal-check; see Box 10 for items that must be
included in training.
Fit-testing6 is the use of a qualitative or quantitative method to evaluate the fit of a specific make, model and
size of respirator on an individual. This procedure is to be done periodically, at least every two years and
whenever there is a change in respirator face piece or the user’s physical condition which could affect the
respirator fit.
6, 9, 11
Seal-checking (also referred to as a ‘fit-check’) is a procedure that the health care provider must perform
each time an N95 respirator is worn to ensure the respirator fits the wearer’s face correctly to provide
adequate respiratory protection.130, 131 Health care providers must receive training on how to perform a
seal-check correctly in order to obtain a tight facial seal. 8, 129, 131, 132
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 47
Recommendations for Occupational Health and Hygiene
57. Provide instruction in the appropriate and correct use and disposal of PPE for staff who are
required to wear PPE. [BII]
58. Staff must not eat or drink in client/patient/resident care areas. [AII]
59. Implement a program to deal with staff exposures, including exposures to blood and body fluids. [AII]
60. Implement a respiratory protection program for staff who will be required to wear an N95
respirator. [Ministry of Labour Requirement]
D. Audits of Compliance with Provision of Feedback
In order to achieve long-term improvement, the health care setting must make infection prevention an
institutional priority and integrate IPAC practices into the organization’s safety culture.11, 18, 147 Improving
adherence to infection control practices requires a multifaceted approach that incorporates ongoing
education and continuous assessment of both the individual and the work environment.18 Staffing levels
should be adequate to allow for compliance.148
Non-compliance with Routine Practices and Additional Precautions may be related to several factors147
:
perceived value of preventive actions
job hindrances (e.g., increased workload, interference with job duties, physical discomfort when
wearing PPE)
availability of PPE in the work area
provision of employee feedback/reinforcement with respect to adherence
organizational level factors promoting a safety climate in the workplace.
Strategies for the evaluation of application of Routine Practices and Additional Precautions are based on
observational audits of compliance and performance feedback with recommendations for
improvement.149 These strategies include:
knowledge and application of written guidelines
correct selection and removal of PPE
compliance with hand hygiene procedures.
Facilities where results of audits and feedback identify issues relating to compliance should provide
ongoing educational and motivational activities to encourage long-lasting improvement in IPAC
practices.
There should be a plan of action for persistent failure. Non-compliance should not be tolerated, as this is
a patient and health care provider safety issue. Compliance results should be part of the performance
appraisal.

APPENDIX B: PERFORMING A RISK ASSESSMENT RELATED TO ROUTINE PRACTICES AND
ADDITIONAL PRECAUTIONS
An individual assessment of each client/patient/resident’s potential risk of transmission of
microorganisms must be made by all health care providers and other staff who come into contact with
them. Based on that risk assessment and a risk assessment of the task, one may determine appropriate
intervention and interaction strategies, such as hand hygiene, waste management, use of personal
protective equipment (PPE) and client/patient/resident placement, that will reduce the risk of
transmission of microorganisms to and from the individual.28 When a client/patient/resident has
undiagnosed symptoms or signs of an infection, interventions must be informed by organizational
requirements.
Risk Assessment Steps to be Performed by a Health Care Provider to Determine an Individual’s Risk of
Transmission of Infectious Agents and the Rationale for Associated Protective Measures
Perform A Risk Assessment
Rationale For Action
Decision #1: Do I need protection for
what I am about to do because there is a
risk of exposure to blood and body fluids,
mucous membranes, non-intact skin or
contaminated equipment?
Intervention and Interaction #1:
Individual Risk Assessment #1
I must follow Routine Practices because
there is a risk that I might expose myself
to an infection that is transmitted via this
route, or expose the
client/patient/resident to my
microorganisms (see algorithms)
Decision #2: Do I need protection for
what I am about to do because the
client/patient/resident has undiagnosed
symptoms of infection?
Intervention and Interaction #2:
Individual Risk Assessment #2
I must alert someone about the
client/patient/resident who has
symptoms so that a diagnosis may be
made, and I must determine what
organizational requirements are to be put
in place to protect myself and others.
Decision #3: What are the organizational
requirements for this
client/patient/resident who has an
identified infection?
Intervention and Interaction #3:
Organizational Risk Assessment
I must follow the procedures proscribed
for this infection to protect myself and
others (see Appendix N).

APPENDIX C: DECISION-MAKING RELATED TO ACCOMMODATION AND ADDITIONAL
PRECAUTIONS
A single room is the preferred accommodation for all clients/patients/residents in all health care
settings. Where single rooms are not available, the following considerations may be taken into account:
1. Accommodation for Clients/Patients/Residents Requiring Droplet
Precautions
There is a requirement for spatial separation of at least two metres and facial
protection for close contact with a client/patient/resident with a new/worse
cough or shortness of breath with fever, or copious uncontrolled respiratory
secretions. The following may be used to determine placement:
 Does the client/patient/resident have:
A new or worse cough or shortness of breath with fever or chills?
Copious uncontrolled respiratory secretions?
Suspected or diagnosed meningococcal disease or meningitis of
unknown etiology?
If yes:
Should be accommodated preferentially in a single room
If a single room is not available, maintain a spatial separation of at least
two metres
Facial protection for close contact with the client/patient/resident
Initiate Contact Precautions if indicated (e.g., respiratory viral infection
also spread by the contact route, such as influenza)
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 59
2. Accommodation for Clients/Patients/Residents with MRSA
Clients/patients/residents known to be colonized or infected with MRSA should
be placed in a single room with individual toileting facilities. In acute care
settings, patients with MRSA should not share rooms with patients without
MRSA.
When single rooms for Contact Precautions are limited, priority should be
given to clients/patients/residents who are at increased risk of disseminating
microorganisms into the environment:
 Does the client/patient/resident have:
A respiratory infection?
Colonized tracheostomy and/or uncontrolled respiratory secretions?
Wound or stoma drainage not contained by a dressing or appliance?
Desquamating skin condition (e.g., psoriasis, burns)?
Cognitive impairment?
Poor compliance with personal hygiene?
If yes:
Should be accommodated preferentially in a single room
If a single room is not available, cohort with other
clients/patients/residents with MRSA, in consultation with Infection
Prevention and Control and on a case-by-case basis
Initiate Contact Precautions
 In non-acute care, MRSA residents should not share a room with:
Individuals who have open wounds or decubitus ulcers
Individuals who have urinary catheters, feeding tubes or other invasive
devices
Individuals whose hygiene is compromised
Individuals who have debilitative or bed-bound conditions that require
extensive ‘hands-on’ care
 If clients/patients/residents with MRSA are accommodated with
clients/patients/residents who do not have MRSA, there must be increased
attention to effective environmental cleaning
PIDAC: Routine Practices and Additional Precautions in All Health Care Settings | November, 2012 60
3. Accommodation for Clients/Patients/Residents with VRE or Clostridium
difficile Infection (CDI)
Clients/patients/residents known to be colonized or infected with VRE or who
have CDI should be placed in a single room with individual toileting facilities. In
acute care settings, patients with VRE/CDI should not share rooms or toileting
facilities with patients without VRE/CDI.
When single rooms for Contact Precautions are limited, priority should be
given to clients/patients/residents who are at increased risk of disseminating
microorganisms into the environment:
 Does the client/patient/resident have:
Diarrhea not contained by diapers?
Faecal incontinence?
Wound or stoma drainage not contained by a dressing or appliance?
Cognitive impairment?
Poor compliance with personal hygiene?
If yes:
Should be accommodated preferentially in a single room
If a single room is not available, cohort VRE clients/patients/residents
with other clients/patients/residents with VRE, and CDI
clients/patients/residents with other clients/patients/residents with
CDI, in consultation with Infection Prevention and Control and on a
case-by-case basis
Clients/patients/residents with VRE or CDI should use a dedicated
commode or bed pan for toileting
Increase attention to effective environmental cleaning
Move to a single room as soon as possible
