NEUROMUSCULOSKELETAL
MUSCLE CONTUSIONS/STRAINS/TEARS/WEAKNESS
Muscle injury and repair
 Inflammation: 24 hrs to 3-4 days
o Myofiber rupture and necrosis
o Hematomas
o Inflammatory cell reaction
 Repair: 5 to 14 days
o phagocytosis of necrotic fibers
o regeneration of myofibers
o formation of scar tissue
o capillary ingrowth
 Remodeling: 14 to 21+ days  complete will take sometimes up to 2 yrs (tendon)
o maturation of myofibers
o contraction and organization of scar tissue
o recovery of function
Contusion
 muscle injury caused by sudden external force
 result: bleeding in deep muscle regions
 RX  1st 48 hrs:
o PRICE, no HARM (heat, alcohol, running, massage)
o put muscle on as much stretch as possible (prevent healing in shortened range)
o crutches if necessary
o gentle pain-free ROM/stretch
o progressive exercise after acute phase
 Recovery time  dependent on grade:
o I – mild  2-3 wks
o II – moderate  4-6wks – may walk with limp, can continue sport
o III – severe  8 wks - immediate swelling, unable to walk
 Complications
o Compartment syndrome  check capillary refill and sensation, muscle strength
o Myositis ossificans  formation of bone within muscle, suspect if haven’t improved after 2-3 wks
Strains & Tears
 acute or chronic (excessive lengthening vs. over-exertion)
 majority occur in biarticular muscles at the muscle-tendon junction
o mainly occur during ECCENTRIC loading or high intensity, explosive activities
 terminal swing phase of high speed running (long head biceps femoris)
 concurrent hip flexion + knee extension (semimembranosus)
 Risk factors:
o Prior injury, age, unaccustomed activity, training errors, biomechanics (poor control, inflexible)
 Grading:
o I  microscopic tearing  pain/tightness, no weakness  “relative rest” to protect tissues
o II  partial, macroscopic tearing  pain + structural change (laxity, decreased strength)
o III  complete tear  painless + weak, may see lump
 Dx  neurological impairment (myotomal weakness)
 Tearing of blood vessels can cause bruising (increased pressure + pain if intramuscular)
 AX: RULE OUT OTHER CAUSES  look at A/PROM, STRENGTH, MUSCLE LENGTH, LIG/STABILITY TESTS
 RX:
o Acute/Inflammation  PRICE, crutches if LE’s
2
o Repair  modalities (US, IFC), DTF, strength, stretching
o Remodeling  strength (increase load, velocity) + stretching (static/dynamic)
o Return to play if:
 symmetrical muscle length, strength, power, no s/s, core control
 completion of progressive functional progressions + sport specific drills + practice session
Laceration
 RX:
 Cutting of the muscle fibers, require surgical repair with sutures
o Inflammation phase  optimize gait so scar tissue aligns properly for healing
o Repair phase  gradual ROM + strength
o Promote remodeling by gradually increasing the load and velocity
o Careful of muscle force going through sutures
Muscle weakness
 Differentiate between weakness (no pain) vs. contractile lesion (sprain  pain) vs. myotomal weakness
(step-like, no pain)
 Will see  compensation/altered movement patterns
DOMS  delayed onset muscle soreness
 72 hrs after unaccustomed exercise

PERIPHERAL NERVE INJURIES
NEUROPATHY  any nerve disease characterized by  neural function
TRAUMATIC PERIPHERAL NERVE INJURY
 S/S  Motor, sensory, autonomic changes; Pain
 Dx  MRI, nerve conduction test used to confirm
TYPES:
1. NEUROPRAXIA
 Compression of the nerve
 RESULT  segmental demyelination & transient disruption
 RECOVERY  fast, good prognosis (min  wks), as edema resolves
2. AXONOTMESIS
 Disruption of axon, myelin sheath still intact, likely CRUSH INJURY
 RESULT  prolonged disruption, may cause paralysis of the motor, sensory, and autonomic
 RECOVERY  fair prognosis (months), Wallerian degeneration
o Axon re-growth: 1mm/day, upper arm 4-6 months (up to 2 yrs), lower arm 7-9mo, up to 4 yrs
3. NEUROTMESIS
 Completely severed axon and sheath
 RECOVERY  only w/ surgery with variable success  may never recover
PATHOLOGICAL PATTERNS OF NEUROPATHY:
25
1. WALLERIAN DEGENERATION
 Process occurs with laceration or crushing of a nerve  axon separated from cell body (axonotmesis)
o Degeneration occurs distal to site of injury (within 24-36 hours)
o Can affect PNS (Schwann cells) and/or CNS (oligodendrocytes)
 Healing:
o Macrophages remove debris
o Proximal part  sprouting  grow (~1mm/day) + prune off  myelin regrowth
2. SEGMENTAL DEMYELINATION
 Myelin breakdown (demyelination) for few segments, but axons are preserved
o Mostly reversible because Schwann cells make new myelin  restore function
 Some axons may be permanently lost
 Eg. Guillain-Barre Syndrome
o Immune system attacks nerves  1st s&s - weakness + tingling  entire body paralysis
o Hospital  most recover, may have slight weakness/tingling/fatigue
3. (Distal) AXONAL DEGENERATION
 Degeneration of axon cylinder and myelin possibly d/t inability of neuronal body to keep up w/
metabolic demands of axon
 Develops: most distal part of axon  proximal
o IF abnormality persists  axon dies ‘backwards’
 S/S
o Characteristic distal sensory loss + weakness
MYASTHENIA GRAVIS
 Autoimmune attack of ACh receptors at the NMJ
o signal can’t travel from nerve  muscle
 May be precipitated by stressful life events, viral infections,
pregnancy, autoimmune disorders, etc.
 Effects:
o progressive muscle weakness
 cardiorespiratory function
 atrophy
 fatigue
 RX
o Medication  prevent ACh breakdown @ NMJ 
remaining receptors will eventually activate, or
plasmapheresis
o PT
 Activity within tolerance
 Prevent 2° conditions
CHARCOT MARIE TOOTH DISEASE (Hereditary condition of PNS)

26
 RX
o No treatment to change disease course
o Contracture management  stretching, splinting, exercise, IMS, etc.
o Foot care education (prevent damage to skin, joint, muscle, connective tissues)
o Identify & retrain muscle imbalance
 S/S
BELL’S PALSY (facial nerve palsy)
 D/T latent herpes virus
o May have pain few days prior around mastoid  virus causes
inflammation response over facial nerve
o Unilateral facial paralysis
 Weakness in muscles of facial expression
 Inability to close one eye, wink, or whistle
 Drooping of mouth
 Tears, salivation
o corticosteroids, e-stim?, protect eye (patch + eyedrops) until
eye closure possible, massage (treat compensatory
changes), PROM/AROM of facial muscles (eg. raise
eyebrows, wrinkle forehead, flare nostrils, smile, practice vowel sounds, etc.)
o most recover spontaneously
 RX
THORACIC OUTLET SYNDROME
 Entrapment syndrome due to pressure on brachial plexus
o Chronic compression  edema + ischemia of nerve roots  neuropraxia + Wallerian deg
 Risk factors  posture, growth, trauma, body comp

NEUROLOGY
Cerebral Vascular Accident (CVA)/Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) STROKE
 RX
 S/S
o SUDDEN numbness or weakness of face, arm, or leg (especially on one side of the body)
o confusion, dizziness
o trouble speaking or understanding speech
o trouble seeing out of one or both eyes
o trouble walking
o loss of balance or coordination
o severe headache with no known cause
 RISK FACTORS:
o non-modifiable  age (doubles after 55 yrs), M>F, family history, PREVIOUS STROKE OR TIA
o modifiable  HTN, cardiac disease, DM, hypercholesterolemia, smoking,  BMI, cocaine/meth
use, oral contraceptives (?)
 CLASSIFICATION:
o ISCHEMIC STROKE (80%)  caused by thrombosis, embolism, lacunar infarct (in deep area of the
brain, related to diabetes and HTN)
 Response after injury:
 a) death of tissue where there is no blood (core death)
 b) possible preservation of area surrounding core that is supplied by collaterals
(ischemic penumbra) * cerebellum and hippocampus neurons ++ sensitive to
ischemia
 c) release of glutamate, Ca2+, edema, O2 free radicals, degeneration occurs
 get to hospital right away, if ischemic they can get tissue plasminogen activator
(TPA) which will dissolve the clots and restore blood flow (within 3 hours)* NOT
APPROPRIATE FOR HEMORRHAGIC STROKE!!
 Possible surgery to remove clot
o HEMORRHAGIC (20%)  caused by aneurysm and AV malformation, often occurs in younger
people, majority occur in the cerebral cortex or basal ganglia*
 RX
 surgery to stop bleed
 better long term prognosis for recovery of function (than ischemic)
 ABCD score (for prediction of progression and risk of recurrence):
o A= age
o B = blood pressure
o C= clinical features (hemiplegia, speech problems)
o D= duration
 PREVENTION OF RECURRENCE:
o anticoagulation therapy (aspirin)
o lipid lowering agent
o lifestyle change
o exercise
 PROGNOSTIC INDICATORS:
o location, extent, and duration of injury; can they voluntarily move fingers (pyramidal motor
output intact, * white tracts are not plastic), cortical (most grey matter) vs subcortical (white and
grey matter)  grey matter is capable of functional reorganization
 TIA  transient blockage of circulation, mild S/S, resolves usually w/in 24 hours, huge recurrence (80%
within a year), can results in lasting damage
 BRAINSTEM STROKE very disabling will take out ascending and descending tracts
29
Acquired brain injury
1. TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY
 change in brain function d/t external force
 can be accompanied by:
o decrease or loss of consciousness, impaired cognition, physical function, emotion or behavior
(may be temporary or permanent)
 classification:
o a) closed  no skull # or laceration of the brain, meninges not breached, does not require
hitting head
o b) open  meninges breached, exposed brain or laceration
 mechanisms:
o coup (primary mechanical injury)
o contracoup (secondary mechanical injury) including  ischemia, edema
o DAI (diffuse axonal injury)  shearing/tearing from rotational forces in areas of density change
(grey  white matter)
o contusion
o anoxic injury forces
 primary injury: direct damage from mechanical forces, focal or diffuse
 secondary brain injury: circulation deficits (blood flow usually 50% less then pre-injury), edema,
increased ICP, epilepsy/seizure, glutamate, contusions
HEMATOMAS:
EPIDURAL
 outside the dura, 90% associated with skull fractures
 most often in temporal or temporoparietal region
 arterial bleed
SUB-DURAL
 blood collects between arachnoid mater and dura
 often requires surgical intervention (burrholes or craniotomy)
 venous bleed
SUBARACHNOID
 fatal
 bleeding between arachnoid and pia mater of brain
INTRACRANIAL
 most common
 blood within the brain  bleed under pia mater
Intracranial pressure:
 normal is 0-10mm Hg, 15 mm Hg usual cut off, >20mm Hg for over 5 minutes is not good
 monitor using:
 extraventricular drain (EVD, most common), subarachnoid or subdural bolt, intraparenchymal
monitor, epidural sensor
 for EVD: have to close stopcock to avoid backflow of large amounts of fluid back into patient 
*ALWAYS CHECK PHYSICIAN ORDERS!*
Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP):
 MAP-ICP/cerebral vascular resistance * want between 70-100 mm Hg
 *HEAD OF BED AT 30 DEGREES to keep MAP at least 80 mmHg
- also prevents ventilator associated pneumonia !!
30
OTHER TRAUMATIC INJURIES
 Basal skull fracture
 Coma
- signs are blood or CSF out of nose or ears, raccoon eyes, bruising over mastoid (battle sign)
- altered state of consciousness so that no amount of stimulus or only pain will cause Pt to
respond, patient in not aware of self or others, lasts for short length of time then either recovers or
turns into death or vegetative state
 Frontal lobe injury
- poor planning and judgment, disinhibition
- Broca’s aphasia (problem with language production)
- altered manners, morals, and emotions
 Parietal lobe injury
- somatosensory function alterations in touch, pressure, temp, and position awareness, some
language comprehension (Wernicke’s), motor planning issues (apraxia)
 Temporal lobe
- Comprehensive and receptive aphasia (Wernicke’s and Broca’s), memory impairment, auditory
processing, integration and regulation of emotion, motivation, and behavior
 Occipital Lobe
- more damaged in contra-coup injury then coup
- see visual problems and visual field deficits
PT RELATED ISSUES & TX
 Respiratory Issues:
- RX
- decrease LOC, compromised respiratory center, increased oral secretions
 manual techniques, suctioning etc. should be used with caution
 suction: pre and post O2 should be 100% , only suction for 10 seconds
 ICP control:
- RX
- maintain neutral head at all times, keep Rx short and combine Rx with other procedures
 monitor ICP  HEAD DOWN POSTURE FOR DRAINAGE IS CONTRAINDICATED!!
 Abnormal Posturing  contributes to handling and contracture formation
- Decerebrate posturing  indicates brain stem damage (lesions or compression in midbrain) and
lesions in cerebellum  extension of UE and LE
- Decorticate posturing  arms flexed, legs extended, damage to areas including cerebral
hemisphere, thalamus, cord, corticospinal tract
- RX  ICP< 15 mm Hg, regular 2 hrs turns, log roll alignment for head, look for amount of pillows in
bed
 Decreased mobility
- RX
 sit up and dangle should begin as soon as medically stable , make sure tube feeds are
off 20 mins prior to Rx, early mobilization to prevent heterotrophic ossification
 other things to be aware of: hypermetabolism, DVTs, PEs
 Contractures
- RX
 place muscles in lengthened position, 20 minutes to 12 hours/day, use of resting splints;
splinting and casting and passive ROM
 Confusion/agitation
- RX
 keep instructions short and simple, avoid over stimulation, be aware of mental and
physical fatigue
 protect joints especially if have flaccidity, transfers take more people, have environment
prepared
 Fatigue
 Family/Caregiver Stress  need consistency between health care team

 Baseline cognitive Ax: SCAT 5 (will usually do training season)
 Second Impact Syndrome
o rare/fatal uncontrolled swelling of brain
o minor 2nd blow before initial symptoms are resolved
 Post-Concussion Syndrome:
o persistent symptoms
o 3+ concussions = 5X greater risk Alzheimer’s, 3x memory deficits
o GRADES:
 grade 1: does not lose consciousness, dazed
 grade 2: no LOC, period of confusion, does NOT recall event
 grade 3: loss of consciousness for short time, NO memory of event, requires eval asap,

OUTCOME MEASURES/PROGNOSTIC INDICATORS
i. Glasgow coma scale:
a. 3 categories: eye opening, verbal response, motor response,
b. total score out of 15
c. done usually in acute injury
ii. Rancho Levels of Cognition
a. good predictor of functional outcomes after injury (1-10 scale)
b. want a higher score
c. *note  pediatric scale is opposite, want a lower score)
iii. Length of LOC
a. usually note 20 minutes or 6 + hours
iv. Length of Post Traumatic Amnesia
a. 5 mins- 7 days; can be anterograde or retrograde
v. Review of Diagnostic Imaging
a. most change in function occurs in first 6 months  unlimited time for functional improvement!!
vi. Outcome Measure Not Totally Predictive of Function:
a. preinjury health, social support, age, nature of injury (location and extent), patient motivation 
ALL PLAY FACTOR
SPINAL CORD INJURY
Causes of SCI:
1. Traumatic
a. majority result in quadriplegia
b. Causes  Falls (40%), transport, sports, other
c. M>F, occur between age 15-35 year range
d. 17.37% are thoracic and lumbar complete
e. 40% are cervical incomplete
32
2. Non-trauma
a. majority result in paraplegia
b. Causes: cancer, infection and inflammation (TB), motor neuron disorders, vascular diseases
(spinal cord infarcts), congenital
c. M>F, 50-60 years +
 BONY INJURY DOES NOT EQUAL A SPINAL INJURY!!!
 Early management focus:
o spinal stability
o limiting neurological deficit and promote recovery
o minimize complications
o create environment for spinal column to heal
 Surgery if:
o unstable # or soft tissue injury,
o neuro symptoms getting worse
o *consider comprehension, cooperation, consciousness of patient
Myelopathy  refers to pathology of the spinal cord  when due to trauma, it is known as spinal cord injury
Lumbar laminectomy  helps to decompress the cauda equina/roots
Goals:
i) keep MAP between 80-100 mm Hg
ii) because the ANS is interrupted regulation of BP, temp, and HR is altered:
 if patient has fever make sure it’s not due to sepsis or other injuries
SHOCK:
1. Spinal shock
a. temporary suppression of all reflex activity below level of injury
b. can last weeks to months
c. SYMPTOMS
i. areflexia
ii. flaccid paralysis below level of lesion
iii. loss of sensation below level of lesion
d. thought that return of the sacral reflexes mark beginning of spinal resolution
2. Neurogenic shock
a. body’s reaction to sudden loss of sympathetic control
b. occurs with injuries above T6
c. SYMPTOMS:
i. decreased vasomotor tone = hypotension & hypothermia despite normal blood volume
ii. bradycardia (because of unopposed vagal stimulation of heart)
iii. can lead to metabolic issues
MOBILITY ORDERS FROM DOCTOR
“Spine unstable”
 column is assumed unstable
 +/- neuro deficits
 definite risk for additional injury
 Pt must:
o maintain neutral spine at all times
o bed rest
o HOB at zero degrees
o 2-3 person turns at all times
33
“Spine stable” but requires protection
 confirmed spinal column
 +/- neuro deficits
 Pt must maintain neutral spine at all times
 Pt can turn independent with neutral alignment
 mob and rehab begins
“Spine stable-no restrictions”
 injury decided stable by surgeon
 patient may do all movements of spine within comfort limits
 Pt may be taught to log roll with neutral spine
 watch for changes in BP when first mobilizing
 may use stockings, binders, or meds to help with postural hypotension**
SCI CLASSIFICATION
 Important to classify to define level and extent of injury
 gives a baseline  used for prognosis and outcome measure
ASIA: ISNSCI
(international standards for neurological classification of SCI)
 universally standardized, valid and reliable, well defined method
Sensory exam
 28 dermatomes with bony landmarks, skin on cheek is the normal
reference  light touch and pin prick tested on each point
 Grade 0: absent
 Grade 1: altered, including hyperesthesia
 Grade 2: Pt normal
 NT = not tested
 pin prick response: normal, impaired (different from reference
point), absent (unable to differentiate)
 Sacral sensory:
o Deep Anal Pressure (DAP): if present, Pt has a sensory
incomplete injury ASIA B
o Either absent or present
Motor exam
 10 bilateral myotomes
 start with grade 3 and watch for compensation
o grade 4 and 5 = static hold in a shortened position
o whole numbers (not + or -)
 Movements:
o C5 Shoulder ABD/elbow flexors
o C6 wrist extensors
o C7 elbow ext
o C8 thumb ext/ ulnar dev, long finger flexors
o T1 finger abductors
*underlined muscles are the official ones to test for ASIA scale
 Sacral Motor  voluntary anal contraction  if present indicates MOTOR INCOMPLETE (ASIA C)
o Present or absent
Level of lesion
 defined as the most caudal segment with normal sensory and motor function on both sides of body
 Sensory level  most caudal segment w/ bilateral score of 2 for both light touch and pin prick
 Motor level  most caudal segment with a grade greater than or equal to 3 provided ALL segments
above are grade 5
34
Prognosis for neuro injuries
 pinprick preservation (LE and sacral) within 72hrs = good prognosis of motor function to return and ability
to walk
SCI CLINICAL SYNDROMES
TRACTS
 Complete injury
o no sensory or motor function is preserved in the sacral segments S4-S5
o may be dermatomes below the sensory level and myotomes below the motor level that remain
partially innervated  The Zone of Partial Preservation
 the most caudal segment with some sensory defines extent of ZPP (within 3 segments
below injury)
 Anterior Cord Syndrome (flexion injury)
o loss of motor function (weakness at or below depending on location)
o bilateral loss of pain and temperature below level of the lesion
o dorsal column is spared (i.e. kinesthesia, proprioception, vibration)
 Posterior Cord Syndrome
o Loss of vibration and proprioception below level of lesion
o Vitamin B12 deficiency
 Central Cord Syndrome
o most common syndrome, generally in hyperextension injuries
o upper motor and sensory function more impaired than LE
o often associated with spinal canal stenosis
 Brown Sequard
o one side of cord more damaged than the other (hemi-section with stab wound, tumor, etc.)
o IPSILATERAL loss of motor function and dorsal column function (vibration, proprioception)
because they cross in medulla
o CONTRALATERAL loss of pain and temperature sensation a few levels below the lesion
 Cauda Equina
o spinal cord terminates at L1-L2
o more LMN lesion
o areflexive and flaccid bladder and bowel
 Conus Medullaris
o injuries at conus  can affect both conus and root resulting in a varied neuro picture
o i.e. mixture of UM and LMNL
 Lateral spinothalamic tract  PAIN + TEMP
 Anterior spinothalamic tract  CRUDE TOUCH + PRESSURE
 Dorsal columns  FINE TOUCH, STEREOGNOSIS, VIBRATION
 Lateral corticospinal  the 90% that cross in the pyramid motor
 Anterior corticospinal  the 10% cross at the level of innervations motor
SCI EFFECTS ON RESP FX
 Cough function
o C1-C3 absent, C4-T1 nonfunctional, T2-T4 poor, T5-T10 weak, T11 and below is normal
 C4 is normally the level Pt’s need to breathe independently
 T11 and below, normal vital capacity
 Muscle innervation
o C2-C7 innervate accessory mm of breathing
o C3-5 innervates diaphragm
o T1-T11 intercostals
35
o T6-L1 abdominals
LEVELS OF INJURY
C1-C4
o Patterns of weakness  paralysis of trunk and UE, probably diaphragm
o Possible movements: neck movements, slight shoulder retraction and adduction
o Role of PT: ROM, spasticity management, neck strengthening, chest physio, prevent contractures
o Major mm innervated:
o FULL:
 C1-C3 SCM, neck extensors, neck flexors
 C2-C4 traps
o PARTIAL:
 C3-C5 Lev scap, diaphragm, supraspinatus, infraspinatus
 C4-C5 rhomboids
C5:
C6:
o Patterns of weakness
o sig imbalance around shoulder girdle
o absence of elbow ext, wrist pronation, ext, flex or any hand/finger movement
o Possible mvmt
o shoulder abd, flex, ext, elbow flexion and supination, scapular add and abd
o Major mm innervated:
o FULL:
 all of the C4 mm plus diaphragm, rhomboids (C4-5 dorsal scapular), levator scapula (C3-
4 and dorsal scapular)
o PARTIAL:
 Deltoid, biceps, brachioradialis, teres minor (C5-6)
 at risk of contracture because of unopposed antagonist
o Hand function  use wrist splints and universal cuffs
o may be able to use tenodesis grip with forearm supination and pronation to achieve wrist flexion
and extension
 FIRST LEVEL OF SCI to have potential to live in community w/o care
 Patterns of weakness  no wrist flexion, elbow ext, hand movement
 Possible mvmt
- radial wrist ext, some horizontal adduction
- can extend elbow in some positions using ER of shoulder
- have tenodesis grip which permits a weak grasp w/o any hand mm
 Slide board transfer possible, manual W/C possible
 PT role:
- maximize strength for transfer to functional tasks, teach “trick” mvmt strategies, ROM and
stretching, prescribe equipment
- lats, serratus, and pecs allow weight bearing through extremity and appropriate hamstring
length will allow them to sit upright and free up hands
C7-C8
 Patterns of weakness  limited grasp and release dexterity d/t lack of intrinsic mm of hand
 Mvmt possible
o elbow ext (C7), wrist ext, DIP/PIP flex (C8), MP flex (C8)
o Triceps allow independent transfers, manual W/C, independent with most/all ADL’s
 Hand function
o C7
 Uses more of the tenodesis grip
o C8
 Have more finger flexors
 gives finger and thumb flexors (which are weak) and no lumbricals
 can get more hand function but fine motor control is still hard
36
T1-9 (Thoracic Paraplegia)
 intact UE function, mainly use W/C * living primarily in community*
 respiratory function compromised above T6
 can have spasticity in trunk that is worse the higher the lesion level
 can stand in standing frame
T10-L1

AUTONOMIC EFFECTS OF SCI ON HEART AND LUNGS
Sympathetic NS  FIGHT OR FLIGHT
 Chain T1-L1
 EFFECTS:
o HR and BP and blood flow to skeletal mm
o RELAXES bronchial mm
 (one would think it would contract them BUT if a bear was chasing you, you would want
the mm to relax to increase O2 supply)
Parasympathetic NS
 Craniosacral
 primary interest in Vagus nerve
 EFFECTS:
o  HR and contractility
o  blood flow to smooth mm (rest and digest)
o contracts bronchial mm
WITH LEVEL OF INJURY T6 AND ABOVE (IN GENERAL)
 Sympathetic effect  dependent on level of injury (b/c it goes from T1-L1)
 Parasympathetic effect  remains intact and UNOPPOSED via the vagus nerve in injuries T6 and higher
o Heart response is d/t vagal withdrawal rather than sympathetic drive
 (normally sympathetic  HR but it is no longer intact, therefore must rely on removing
parasympathetic)
 Limits cardiac output + shunting of blood from inactive  active ones
 Blunting of heart rate often to only 110 -120bpm
37
AUTONOMIC DYSREFLEXIA
 caused by massive sympathetic discharge from a noxious or non-noxious stimuli below level of SCI (with
injuries above T6)
 S/S:
o BP of 20-30 mm Hg from normal

VESTIBULAR DISORDERS
 cause of dizziness  cardiovascular, neurological, visual, psychogenic, cervicogenic, meds, vestibular
 VESTIBULAR FUNCTIONS
o gaze stabilization
 objects in visual field stay clear with head movement
o postural stabilization
 maintain balance and equilibrium
o resolution of sensory motor mismatch
47
 proprioception, vestibular and visual  sea sickness/motion intolerance
 ANATOMY
o SEMICIRCULAR CANALS x 3  horizontal, anterior, posterior
 Fx  gaze/angular displacement of the head
 movement of endolymph will deflect hair cells and excite or inhibit neurons (CNVIII)
o OTOLITH x 2  utricle- detects horizontal plane motion, and saccule- detects sagittal plane
motion;
 together detect acceleration and deceleration, gravitational pull= POSTURAL
 HISTORY  highly important w/ vestibular disorder!!!
 Common VESTIBULAR S/S
o vertigo= the subjective experience of nystagmus (room spinning around you) - get it with BPPV *
always vestibular in origin
o dizziness= discrepancy between R and L side, patient can’t work out where they are in space
 *non-specific, may or may not be vestibular in origin
o oscillopsia=blurred vision * NOT THE SAME A DIPLOPIA
o antibiotic= GENTAMYCIN = affects vestibular system

Neuroplasticity: use it or lose it, use it and improve it, specificity, repetition**, intensity, time matters, salience
matters, age matters, transference, interference * no drug alone will improve neuroplasticity, intervention needs
to be paired with behavior; requires: task specific practice, dose? 6 hrs per day?

o referral to health care team (meds, Botox, etc.)
 TREATMENT FOR:
 CLONUS (proprioceptive reflex)
o teach them to contract the muscle with the clonus then relax
 CUTANEOUS HYPERREFLEXIA
o desensitize, promote active movements within limits of individual’s capacity, strap legs when
in wheelchair to prevent falling
CEREBELLAR LESIONS
 Ataxia  failure of muscle coordination; irregularity of muscle action
 AX
o coordination
 1) UE: finger to nose (elbow straight), dysdiadochokinesia, (elbows not supported on lap),
finger opposition
 2) LE: toe tapping, heel on shin * do at same time, then separate; start slow then fast*
record how many reps and quality
o balance
 Romberg (differentiate from somatosensory deficit),
o functional
 TUG, 10 m walk
o postural control
o prevent and treat biomechanical limitations
o promote muscle strength, endurance, and coordination
o start with specific strategies: small range near midline, work out, progress: decrease guidance,
cueing, number of fixed points, increase active ROM, speed, change direction
 RX
OROFACIAL
o complete peripheral nerve injury (not recoverable), incomplete – potential to recover, UMN
injury – recovery is variable
o Ax:
 facial expression: wrinkle forehead, tightly close eyes, smile widely, purse lips together, smile wide and
protrude chin

o 1.3 m/s – average walking speed for community ambulators
 make it task specific, salient, and representative of what the patient is returning to
 consider  walking aids, orthoses, FES
REACH AND GRASP
POSITIONING
 Consider  postural control, transport, and manipulation (grasp) * all systems are parallel
o Rx needs to integrate all systems
 ballistic movements are preprogrammed and don’t require sensory feedback
o manipulation does (needs to figure out grip force)
 To Use Hand
o move hand to object desired, look and pay attention to the hand and environment, make
postural adjustments prior to and during arm movement, utilize somatosensory feedback
required for manipulation
 Reach
o trunk control, elbow extension, pronation, stable scapula and shoulder, wrist extension, finger
opening
 Grasp
o radial deviation and wrist extension, thumb opposition
 Holding
o sensation
 Manipulation

 stenosis or fusion of valve leaflets  valves fail to open completely  impedes forward-flow
 regurgitations (insufficiency)  valves fail to close in systole  reverse blood flow
DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY
 increased mass of the heart  difficulty pumping (can fill but can’t
contract)  blood backs up into pulmonary circulation
 stagnant blood increases risk of clotting
 risk factors: increased volume with pregnancy (third trimester), chronic
alcohol use (~10 yrs), chemotherapy drugs
HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY

independently
o Chest wall no longer rigid  less ventilation on that side
 Accompanied with pulmonary contusion  bruising of the lung
sections
o Usually main cause of respiratory failure
 Paradoxical breathing:
 Inspiration
o flail segment sucks in  lung, heart, mediastinum shift
away, reducing air entry into the unaffected lung
 Expiration
o flail segment pushes outward  Lung, heart,
mediastinum are pushed toward flail segment
o pain control
o intubation/ventilation if necessary
o O2, airway clearance
 RX

IPPA
 trachea starts at cricoid cartilage to T4 spinous process posteriorly, R bronchi is more steeply angled
and gets more things caught in it
 sternal angle between manubrium and body – where rib 2 attaches and carina of trachea is at this
level
 diaphragm is at the level of the 8th thoracic vertebra, moves 1-2 cm in quiet breathing
 quiet inspiration: diaphragm and external intercostals; forced: SCM, scalene, pec minor
 quiet expiration: passive recoil of lung tissue; forced: internal intercostals and abs
 basic principles: positioning, draping, room set up, and biomechanics of therapist
80
INSPECTION:
 lines, monitors (HR, RR, SPO2, BP)
 position of patient
 head: facial expression, orientation to place, person, and time x3, speech, skin (colour, sweat, temp),
lips, nose (flaring), neck (accessory muscle use, jugular vein distension), chest (deformity, shape, muscle
wasting), breathing type (apical, diaphragmatic, accessory muscle use), chest movement, limbs
(colour, clubbing, edema), cough (weak vs strong, productive vs nonproductive), sputum (colour, smell,
amount, and texture)
PALPATION:
 chest wall expansion (upper, middle, lower x2 (front and back)), take deep breaths
 tactile fremitus (use ulnar border of hands, feel for vibration), same locations as above
 tracheal position: base of sternum
 RATES: HR (15 seconds), BP (use cuff), RR (30-60 seconds, not 15!!)
PERCUSSION:
 middle finger over intercostals space with non-dominant hand, ax right vs left anterior to posterior
upper, middle, and lower lobes
 SOUNDS:
o 1) resonant (normal)
o 2) dull = consolidation, pleural fluid
o 3) hyper-resonant = air
AUSCULTATION:
 diaphragm of stethoscope picks up high pitch better, the bell picks up low pitch better
 EXPOSE THE SKIN!!
 instruct patient to take a deep inspiration/expiration, rest between breaths as needed
 gold standard lobe points: 11 in front, 14 in the back
BREATH SOUNDS
 NORMAL
o Vesicular
o Bronchial – hollow, short pause between inspiration and expiration, normal over trachea (air
travelling through larger airways)
 ABNORMAL
o Bronchial – consolidated pneumonia, lobar collapse
o Decreased or absent – over pleural effusion, hemothorax, pneumothorax, emphysema,
contused lung, obese, elderly
 ADVENTITIOUS
o Crackles (rales) – inspiratory vs expiratory (early (airway obstruction) late (edema, fibrosis, partial
consolidation)
o Wheezes (rhonchi) – inspiratory vs expiratory, high (uniformly narrowed) or low pitch
(intermittently narrowed)
o Stridor – loud musical constant pitch with laryngeal or tracheal obstruction
o Pleural rub – creaky, leathery sound due to pleural irritation
81
CHEST X RAY
FRONTAL
1. IS IT PA OR AP?
- PA is usually standard, AP usually if it has to be done on bedside (mediastinum is magnified, dec inspiration,
patient position is compromised)
2. IS IT OVER OR UNDEREXPOSED?
- overexposed will be completely black, has to be uniform, no patches!
3. IS IT SATISFACTORY INSPIRATION?
- 9 ribs post or 6 ribs anterior above the dome of the left diaphragm
4. IS THE PATIENT ROTATED?
- draw vertical line from T1-4 and measure line to medial end of clavicle (rotated towards side w/ larger space)
5. IS THE HEART ENLARGED?
- look at A/B ratio A= width of heart B= width of inside of lung cavity; should not be over 50%
6. ARE BOTH DOMES OF DIAPHRAGMS CLEARLY SEEN AND WELL DEFINED (SILHOUETTE SIGNS); costophrenic
angles, costocardiac angles, and right dome * indicates what lobe the pathology is in
7. WHAT IS THE POSITION OF THE MEDIASTINUM?
- tracheal shift: should be in line with the T1-4 vertebrae
SHIFTING RULE= shift away from increased volume, shift towards decreased volume
- position of mediastinum: 2:1 R: L
8. LANDMARKS IN MEDIASTINUM?
- look for pulmonary artery, look at cobweb appearance of blood vessels
9. ARE HILA AND FISSURES NORMAL?
- want hila to be the same height or within 1-2 levels of each other, close to bronchi bifurcation
- fissures are seen only in about 50% of x-rays
10. ARE BONES NORMAL? LOOK FOR #
11. CLINICAL REASONING
 Atelectasis: will usually result in shifting of the landmarks, silhouette signs, lobar collapse can be white
because no air is in it, full of secretions
 Consolidation Or Pleural Effusion: lung fields will be opaque, usually will have signs of atelectasis with
consolidation as well, pleural effusion may have blunting of the costophrenic angle, and sometimes
mediastinal shifts to opposite side
 Pneumothorax: dark area because of air, absence of lung markings, fine line showing outline of the
collapsed lung
 Pulmonary Edema: enlarged peripheral vessels, opacities, and fluffy shadows
 COPD: flattened diaphragm, pear shaped heart, enlarged chest cavity,
LATERAL CHEST X RAY * always to be interpreted with a frontal chest x ray
1. ARE THE VERTEBRAL BODIES GETTING BLACKER FROM SUPERIOR TO INFERIOR?  lower lobe pneumonia
2. ARE THE DOMES OF THE DIAPHRAGM WELL DEFINED?  L higher than R, curved or flattened?
3. ARE THE HILA NORMAL?
- pulmonary arteries and bronchi are grey because they have air in them
- RALS: right pulmonary artery – right anterior; left p.a. – left superior
4. CHANGE IN DENSITY ACROSS THE CARDIAC SHADOW?
5. CONFIRM WITH FRONTAL CHEST X RAY
82
ARTERIAL BLOOD GASES (ABG’s)
 PO2 only measures free unbound O2 molecules, is the driving force for Hb saturation with O2;
o PO2 is determined by 1) alveolar ventilation 2) V/Q 3) FiO2
 ABG’s: measure of partial pressure and pH of O2 and CO2 in the blood
 gas moves from high  low pressure, PCO2 is controlled by ventilation
 H + HCO3- <-> H2CO3 <-> H2O + CO2
 [reg by renal] [reg by resp]
 NORMAL RANGES:
1. pH 7.35-7.45
2. PaCO2 35-45
3. HCO3- 22-28
4. PaO2 80-100 mm Hg
5. SaO2 95-100 %
 metabolic and respiratory acidosis = the pH is lower than normal
 metabolic and respiratory alkalosis = the pH is higher than normal
 respiratory acidosis = pH dec, PaCO2 inc, HCO3 normal
 respiratory alkalosis = pH inc, PaCO2 dec, HCO3 normal
 metabolic acidosis = pH dec, PaCO2 normal, HCO3 dec
 metabolic alkalosis= pH inc, PaCO2 normal, HCO3 inc
RULES
1. look at pH first to see what primary process it is (acidosis or alkalosis)
2. remember clinical context (respiratory or metabolic condition)
3. respiratory compensation can take minutes to hours
4. renal compensation can take 1-5 days to occur
5. compensation can be partial or total
6. for alveolar hypoventilation the PO2 should only decrease 1 mmHg for every 1 mmHg increase in
PaCO2
LINES
- ART LINE – constantly monitor arterial BP
o may be inserted into radial, axillary, femoral or pedal artery
o precautions
 infusion bag must be kept above insertion site
 notify RN if transducer disconnected
 ROM restrictions (ie. no hip flexion past 90° with femoral ART line)
- PICC LINE – to deliver chemotherapy or antibiotics (often simultaneously)
o inserted into large vein of the arm near bend of elbow and pushed until tip sits above heart
o precautions
 do not mobilize until proper insertion confirmed with x-ray
- ECG – electrical activity of heart
o sternotomy – limitations in lifting (10 lb. above waist, no pushing STS, and no pull/push over 5 lbs.)
- PATIENT CONTROLLED ANALGESIC = self-administered meds, will preset how much they can get
o look for BP drop, RR less than 10, altered mental status
- EPIDURAL – careful with movements of trunk, hips, LE – can be very uncomfortable
o always check orders
o if dislodged get help immediately
- NG tube
o feed is kept above site of insertion, need feeds turned off before start of therapy, HEAD OF BED
NOT FLAT FEED WILL FLOW BACK (keep at least 30 degrees incline)!
- CHEST TUBE
- URINARY CATHETER
o keep below site of insertion to prevent backflow
o Foley- keep below site of insertion to prevent backflow
83
OXYGEN THERAPY
1. INDICATIONS
 SaO2 less than 90% or PaO2 less than 80 mm Hg
  work of breathing
 acute MI or to decrease myocardial work
 short term post-surgery for recovery
 RT for O2 greater than 40%, acute respiratory distress, transport with O2, and artificial airway (trach)
2. SYSTEMS
- LOW FLOW SYSTEM: supplemental O2 to tidal volume
o nasal prongs (6 L max), simple mask, partial rebreathing, and non-rebreathing mask
- HIGH FLOW: enough O2 to supply the entire tidal volume
o venturi face mask, face tent, tracheostomy mask
- 1 L/MIN = 24 % O2 * goes up by 4% every L 
INCENTIVE SPIROMETRY
 PURPOSE: patients with atelectasis; provides visual input/incentive goal (NO evidence use of IS to
prevent post-op complications)
 NEED: Incentive spirometer (little blue plastic thing); either flow (accordion) or volume (ball)
 INITIAL SESSION:
 METHOD: Sustained inspiratory effort ~3 sec, relaxed expiration; attempting to achieve max inspiration
to TLC
 CONTRAINDICATIONS: cognitive impairment, patients unable to deep breathe effectively due to pain,
diaphragmatic dysfunction, or opiate analgesia, Patients unable to generate adequate inspiration with
a vital capacity <10 mL/kg or an inspiratory capacity <33% of predicted normal.
INSPIRATORY MUSCLE TRAINING
 PURPOSE: retrain muscles of inspiration (diaphragm, external intercostals, etc.) in populations needing it
(evidence support for COPD, CHF, endurance athletes, SCI)
 NEED: reliable measure of max inspiratory pressure + max expiratory pressure (pulmonary tests); can use
a resistive trainer, threshold trainer (COPD, CHF, athletes), or normocapnic hyperpnea (athletes, SCI)
 INITIAL SESSION: Start w/ 5 min, progress over 2-3 weeks to 2x15 min or 1x30 min sessions, 4-5 days/week,
begin at 20-30% MIP and progress to 50% MIP as tolerated, fit individuals can progress to 70% carefully
 MONITOR: vitals for signs of cardio-respiratory distress
 CONTRAINDICATIONS: Acute respiratory failure, cognitive impairment (cannot keep it clean)
VQ MATCHING
 shunting: normal perfusion but no ventilation (alveoli is collapsed and the capillary is expanded)
 dead space unit: normal ventilation with poor perfusion (capillary is completely collapsed and the
alveoli is enlarged)
 silent unit: no ventilation or perfusion (both are collapsed)
 for atelectasis  to encourage re-expansion, put the diseased lung in the non-dependent position and
do unilateral breathing exercises in this position
NORMAL ABNORMAL EFFECT OF MECHANICAL VENT
Ventilation Greatest in
dependent regions
Best in non-diseased
areas
Air follows path of least
resistance, usually best in
non- dependent region
Perfusion Greatest in
dependent regions
Unless restricted will flow
to gravity dependent
regions
Increased pressure can
restrict blood flow to non-
dependent regions
Treatment principle Lower regions of lungs
have greatest surface
area therefore best
VQ matching in
upright lung
Generally place the
affected area in non-
dependent position to
increase VQ matching
(bad lung up)
Regular position changes, no
one best position,
experiment, think about
proning
84
BREATHING EXERCISES
Why?
  ventilation, to prevent atelectasis, WOB and O2 consumption, to remove secretions,
  chest wall mobility and for relaxation
 BREATHE IN THROUGH NOSE AND OUT THROUGH MOUTH!!
Diaphragmatic Breathing
 INDICATIONS: post op patients, respiratory failure, chronic respiratory distress
 WHY?
o lung expansion and compliance, reduces VQ mismatch,  respiratory muscle strength
 HOW?
o Slow inspiration to lower lung lobes (start with patient in lying or sitting, you use your hand then
they use their own hand for feedback), expansion of belly is PASSIVE monitor upper chest
movement, do 3-4 cycles of deep breaths, prescription: 10 breaths per hour
 ADDITIONS
o end inspiratory hold (hold 3-5 seconds before relaxed expiration), single percussion, sniff,
lateralcostal breathing (use hands for feedback)
Pursed Lip Breathing
 INDICATIONS: good for COPD patients
 HOW? Inhale with lips in pucker position for 2 counts, exhale for 4 counts (exhalations 2x longer then
inhalations)
Segmental Breathing
 INDICATIONS: healthy individuals can direct O2 in the upper or lower lung fields upon instruction
 HOW? Tactile stim or pressure to increase expansion of specific areas, pressure on inspiration and relax
on expiration
Incentive Spirometry/Sustained Max Inspiration
 INDICATIONS: same uses as diaphragmatic breathing, just as good
 HOW? Sustain inspiratory effort for 3 seconds, then relax expiration, max inspiration to TOC, give a visual
reminder and an incentive goal; can be flow or volume sensitive
Breath Stacking
 INDICATIONS? When breathing is painful, vent dependent patients NOT COPD PATIENTS!!
 HOW? Take a breath, hold, add another breath, hold and repeat until capacity is reached (can follow
up with pursed lip breathing), slow exhalation
SOS FOR SOB
 INDICATIONS? For respiratory distress in COPD patient
1. stop and rest in comfortable position
2. get head down
3. get shoulders down
4. breathe in through mouth
5. breathe out through mouth
6. breath in and out as fast as you want
7. begin to blow out longer, but not forcibly, used pursed lip breathing if you find it effective
8. begin to slow breathing
9. begin to use nose
10. begin diaphragmatic breathing
11. stay in position for 10 minutes longer
85

o hand placement (1-2 people, landmark xiphoid process and umbilicus), or upper chest
o position as indicated
o palpate breathing pattern, tell patient plan for 3 big inspirations then on the 4th you will cough *
watch body mechanics
o after coughing, ensure proper secretion removal (suction or patient spit)
2. PLAIN COUGH
 look at positioning, combining it with manual techniques, splinting (for pain, use pillow), tracheal tickle
3. HUFFING (FORCED EXPIRATORY TECHNIQUE, FET)
 INDICATIONS? For improving secretion clearance, as an adjunct to manual techniques
 PROCEDURE:
o 2 reps of huffing (not forceful enough to cause pain, just to move a tissue away from you if you
held one up), mouth is in “O” shape, glottis remains open
o arms can be by side or in chicken wing position
o abdominals and chest wall will tighten
o follow with diaphragmatic breathing
POSTURAL DRAINAGE /POSITIONING
 always make sure you know the unique contraindications of the patient: spinal injury, blood pressure
 upright and mobile is the best position

after for redness; duration: 2-5 minutes
o CONTRAINDICATIONS/PRECAUTIONS: # ribs, prone to hemorrhage, metastatic bone cancer,
osteoporosis, burns, subcutaneous emphysema of neck and thorax, poor/unstable CV condition,
recent skin graft or flap, resectable tumor, pneumothorax
 VIBRATIONS: remove bronchial secretions and improve tidal volume
o PROCEDURE: done on exhalation, in conjunction with other techniques, duration: 5 minutes * can
use mechanical vibrator machines but they are not very effective (may be appropriate for
fragile patients: osteoporotic, or elderly
 RIB SPRINGING
o chest compression followed by overpressure and quick release at end expiration, can be
combined with percs and vibs, thought to increase chest expansion and therefore a bigger
inspiration
MANUAL HYPERINFLATION

o deep breathing for 3-4 breaths, and hold 3 seconds,
o normal breaths for 2-3 breaths
o huff: medium breath in and repeat 2-3 times
o if sputum not produced go back to normal breathing and repeat, if sputum, then repeat huff 2-3
times

o try not to cough, then practice coughing and huffing, takes longer 30-45 mins, 2x a day
POSITIVE EXPIRATORY PRESSURE (PEP)
 INDICATIONS: one-way valve mask that creates resistance on expiration, to keep airways open to get
behind mucus via collateral airways and help secretion

 erodes underlying cartilage and bone
 w/ time  pannus may extend to the opposite articular surface creating:
 1) fibrous scar tissue
 2) adhesions
 3) bony ankylosing
 LEADS TO:
 immobility + consolidation (bones form a single unit) of a joint
 bones can become osteopenic
 ligaments/tendons become damaged or ruptured
 surrounding mm deteriorate  joint instability + deformity prone
 RA CRITERIA:
1. morning stiffness >1hr (6 weeks)
2. arthritis of ≥ 3 joints (6weeks)

levels  vessel wall damage  atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction, stroke,
gangrene
 damage to peripheral nerves  diabetic neuropathy
 NORMAL GLUCOSE LEVELS
o fasting plasma glucose: 5.6 mmol/L, diabetes >7 mmol/L
o impaired fasting plasma glucose: <5.6 mmol to >7 mmol/L
 LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES
o peripheral (diabetic neuropathy—ulcers—amputation)

o diabetic retinopathy (blindness)
o heart disease (heart attack, stroke, atherosclerosis)
o infection
104
 RX
o regular exercise = very important
o talk to MD about insulin levels for exercise
o have snack before (have raisins/juice available to boost sugar levels if necessary)
o monitor blood sugar levels pre, during, and post exercise
o avoid exercise at night  person may go to sleep and slip into a hypoglycemic coma and die

CHRONIC PAIN/FIBROMYALGIA
CHRONIC PAIN
 pain that persists past the normal time of healing (usually 3 months)
 SCI  2/3 of patients develop chronic pain
 RX  interdisciplinary team, medications, education, and appropriate exercise
 PAIN
o TRANSMITTED BY
 A delta fibers (high threshold, sharp prickling, localized, fast adapting
 meds work well
 C fibers (low threshold, dull, aching, diffuse, slow adapting and persistent)
 meds  work
o Acute Pain DUE TO
 tissue damage (stimulation of nociceptors)
 inflammatory mediators  inflammation and swelling
 release of cells in plasma (bradykinin, prostaglandins, substance P)
 stimulate pain receptors
o CONDUCTION
 at spinal cord goes up lateral spinothalamic tract to thalamus and to the cortex
 periaqueductal grey  releases endorphins  inhibits subs P and glutamate release
(therefore pain)
 CHRONIC PAIN
o actual chemical changes occur in the tissue and in the brain (limbic)
o receptors become hypersensitive  RESULT  allodynia or hyperalgesia
 activity in pain pathways; these people’s pain is real
o RX
 have to desensitize the area
 educate them that it’s not in their head
 restore normal function to the area
 variety of techniques: chemical (medications), physical (electrotherapy),
cryotherapy, thermotherapy, exercises/stretch (reduce pain caused by muscle
spasm)

LYMPHEDEMA (in oncology section)
SEPSIS
 presence of whole body inflammatory state (SIRS) + presence of known or unknown infection
 SEPTIC SHOCK
o severe sepsis but hypoperfusion abnormalities in spite of adequate fluid resuscitation
o immune system spirals out of control
o normal response to infection is local but then causes widespread vasodilation and vascular
permeability

o pubic area = 1
 RULE OF 9s in KIDS  same torso and same arms but head = 18, each leg = 14
 SCARRING
o ONLY occurs if significant damage to dermis (i.e. with 3rd degree)
 PHASES OF WOUND HEALING
o inflammatory (up to 2 days)
 vascular and cellular effects to eliminate the necrotic tissue and deliver materials for
healing
o proliferative (days to months)
 rebuild the dermis and epidermis, fibroplasias and neovascularization that produce
granulation tissue (early angiogenesis)
o remodeling (months)
 wound contracts and increases strength, scar
 CLASSIFICATION OF WOUND HEALING
o acute vs chronic
o partial vs full thickness
o primary (closed by surgery) vs secondary intention healing (wound left to heal on own)
 ZONES
o Zone of coagulation  point of maximum damage, irreversible tissue loss
o Zone of stasis  tissue perfusion, potentially salvageable
o Zone of hyperemia   perfusion, will recover unless sepsis occurs
 EFFECTS OF BURNS
o CV
  capillary permeability  interstitial edema
 peripheral vasoconstriction
 hypovolemia
 myocardial depression  hypotension and decreased organ perfusion
  cardiac output
o Resp
109
 bronchoconstriction, ARDS, carbon monoxide (dec O2 carrying capacity of blood)
o Metabolism  3x
o Immune system  compromised
o Renal  b/c of loss of fluids  vasoconstriction,  GFR, myoglobin gets processed by kidneys
and can block tubules
 SIGNS OF INHALATION INJURY
o singed eyebrows/nasal hairs/burnt face, black oral/nasal discharge, swollen lips, hoarse voice,
abnormal oxygenation, history of being enclosed in closed room
o Inhalation injury process  w/in 24hrs upper airway obstruction/pulmonary edema

GMFCS (gross motor functional classification system): 5 levels (I= high fxn, V= limited), for kids with CP, based on
self initiated movement, good for communication between families and health care professionals and goal
planning
GMFM (gross motor functional measure): standardized test for gross motor function for children with CP, all
items that a 5 year old (normal development) would do, can measure over time to see change and set realistic
goals
COPM (Canadian occupational performance measure): identifies goals in self care, productivity, leisure, 
family centered

and control
RX, CONSIDER: the environment, the task activity, the instructions you give, and other things like breaks, choices
119
TONE: muscle palpation, prom, quantifying tone, and primitive reflexes (clonus and Babinski), use modified
Tardieu (assess rom at R1 (high velocity) and R2 (end of rom and slow speed), 0-5 (want a lower score)), or
modified Ashworth (5 point scale, 0-4)

Open chain Closed chain
Internal stabilization
Inc joint approximation (dec joint shear)
greater co-contraction and proprioception
and kinesthetic feedback is debateable
Distal segment moves in space Distal segment is fixed or stabilized
Typically NWB Typically WB

least once per day * can be self, mechanical, therapist assisted, etc.)
121
PNF (proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation) STRETCHING
 requires normal innervations and voluntary control of either shortened muscle or it’s opposing muscle
(relaxes contractile structures)
 Types:
o Hold-relax: target muscle passively lengthened, isometric contraction of target muscle (6-10
secs) then relax and passively move into new range
o Agonist-contract: target muscle passively lengthened, concentric contraction of opposing
muscle (antagonist) hold 5-10 seconds, relax and passively move into new range
o Hold-relax agonist contract: target muscle moved passively into lengthened position, isometric
contract of target muscle then relax and concentric contraction of antagonist muscle
FITT PARAMETERS

Joint mobilization
 Accessory joint motions:
o occur naturally during active movement
o required for proper osteokinematics and arthrokinematics (distraction, compression, roll, spin,
glide
 INDICATIONS: decrease passive movement of joint, early capsular EF, mechanical pain
 CONTRAINDICATIONS: #, neoplasm, acute inflammatory process, apparent hypermobility or instability in
direction of technique, bone/joint infection, spinal cord signs or symptoms, spasm or bony end feel
 PRECAUTIONS: impaired circulation or sensation, osteoporosis or compromised health, haemophiliacs,
poor skin condition, open wounds, discomfort in treatment position, marked skeletal deformity
 Based on concave/convex rule of arthrokinematics (movement at joint surface) and osteokinematics
(movement of long bones):
o if concave surface is moving it will move in the same direction as the long bone, if the convex is
moving it will move in the opposite direction of the long bone
 grade based on palpation findings, PIVMs, PAVMs, quality of movement and EF * never mobilize through
a spasm EF
 Grades I- V: Maitland
 I - small amplitude movement at beginning of range:
o with pain before resistance or at resistance (or use traction)
 II - large amplitude movement from beginning to middle of range (before resistance) usually into R1
when tissues start to tighten (when pain before resistance or at resistance)
 III - large amplitude movement from middle to end of available range (into resistance) R2 where
limitation is usually due to a tight capsule (when you get resistance before pain)
 IV - small amplitude movement at end of available range into resistance (when you get resistance
before pain or resistance and no pain)
 V - small amplitude high velocity movement at end of available range (when you have resistance
and no pain)
Kaltenborn Grading (sustained)
i. small amplitude distraction
ii. distraction or glide to take up the slack
iii. distraction or glide to stretch the tissues
- cycle 6-10 second hold
RX:
122
 3x 10 second bouts, checking in with patient
 then re-ax active movement, passive (PIVM or PAVM)
 then repeat 2 more times; always re-ax
 warn patient about treatment soreness and temporary after effects
EFFECTS:
- grade 1 and 2: neurophysiological (dec muscle tone, endorphin and enkaphalin release), mechanoreceptor
stimulation (pain gating), vascular effect (joint nutrition), mechanical effect (mobilize collagen and
neuromeningeal tissue, joint lubrication)
- grade 3 and 4: same as grade 1 and 2 plus: greater mechanical effect and enhanced joint lubrication,
elongate shortened capsuloligamentous tissue
- grade 5: same as pervious grades but with greater neurophysiological and more mechanical effects, joint
cavitation
Joint manipulation
 only talocrural traction manipulation
 INDICATIONS:
o to restore full ROM at end range of DF and PF when the progressive mobilizations are no longer
effective (last 5 degrees)
o to gain last few degrees of DF and PF when a non-capsular limitation of motion is present *
o ALWAYS SUSPECT AN UNDERLYING HYPERMOBILITY AND RE-AX STABILITY
 EFFECTS:
o tearing of the scar tissue
o quick stretch to joint capsule
o stim of mechanoreceptors- neurophysiological effects
 CONTRAINDICATIONS: fracture, joint instability in direction of manipulation, inflammatory joint disease,
malignancy, bone disease, osteoporosis, open wound or skin lesion in area, poor circulation or sensory
deficit in the area, spasm or increased pain with test pull, unsure of health or diagnosis, patient doesn’t
want to be manipulated (informed consent), patient is on anticoagulants, haemophiliacs, inability of
patient to relax, physio factors
 CAUTIONS/CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR NOVICE MANIPULATORS: pain or instability proximally in the lower
kinetic chain, uncertainty about indications of technique, children (skeletal maturity), diabetics, elderly,
positive straight leg raise (for talocrural manip) on effected side
 FOLLOW –UP RX: ROM exercise (assuming joint is stable), post – treatment soreness can occur (suggest
use of ice), balance, proprioception, strength, protected function, taping/bracing if joint is unstable
Soft tissue techniques
DTFM:
 PURPOSE  To maintain/regain mobility, prevent scar tissue adhesions, create hyperemia (inc blood
flow), create analgesia
 EFFECTS  Hyperemia, mechanical stress to break adhesions and align collagen, mechanoreceptor
stim and dec pain
 RX  2-3 cycles per second, at least 3 minutes (or until numbing effect occurs)  5 minutes, literature
says 10-20 minutes, find lesion, friction perpendicular to tissue
 muscle is only done when subacute (5-10 days+) or chronic, tendon and ligament can be done in
acute to chronic
 MUSCLE  have muscle belly relaxed, follow with active contractions in inner range
 LIGAMENT/TENDON  have on pain free stretch, f/u with exercise
 CONTRAINDICATIONS:
o Infection
o skin breakdown
o ossification/calcification
o CT or inflammatory joint disease
123

Fitness/conditioning/endurance exercise programs
Metabolic Syndrome - >3 diagnostic criteria:
o inc blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, waist girth, triglycerides, dec HDL
Functional activity training
 PURPOSE:
o isolate deficits in muscle performance, compensatory movement, give athlete psychological
reassurance, determine the presence of pain
o do as part of pre-screening, in rehab process, and before return to sport
 THINGS TO CONSIDER
o stage of healing (not during acute), ROM, strength/power/endurance, neuromuscular control,
proprioception, core control, prophylactic taping/bracing/padding, responsibilities of the
athlete
 CONTRAINDICATIONS:
o persistent joint effusion
o joint instability
o poor motor control
o lack of ROM
o muscle length and appropriate muscle strength and power (at least 90%)
 CRITERIA FOR RETURN TO PLAY:

and endurance (90%). Correct movement mechanics, adequate cardiorespiratory fitness, have
successful completed progressive functional tests, psychologically ready
 CONCEPTS:
o load, stability, velocity, direction changes, test environment, correct movement mechanics
throughout, energy systems
Positioning - cardioresp section
Posture training
 lengthen what’s tight, strengthen what is weak
 down grade activation in muscles that aren’t supposed to be firing
 correct muscle imbalance or postural faults?
Gait/mobility education and training with or without equipment
124
WALKERS - increase balance and relieve WB (fully or
partially), most stable device, bad for small spaces or
going up stairs, no arm swing, can get no wheel, 2 or
4 wheel; measurement: stand inside, handles to wrist
crease or 20-30 degree elbow flexion holding the
handles
CANE - widen base of support, help balance, least
stable type of aid, measurement: cane parallel to leg
with tip in line with ankle, hand position as per walker
QUAD CANE - not that good for stairs
CRUTCHES - help with lateral stability and improve
balance (inc BOS), helps dec WB; measurement:
have distal end 2 inch lateral and 6 inch in front
anterior to foot, hands placed as per walkers
FOREARM CRUTCHES - allows for use of hands, but need more arm strength to use, usually used in higher
functioning patients or may or may not use them for longer term use; measurement: cuff on prox 1/3 of
forearm, 1-1.5 inches below elbow
NORMAL GAIT: stance 60%, swing 40%
 Non-weightbearing (NWB), feather weightbearing (FeWB), partial weightbearing(PWB, ~50% weight),
weight bearing as tolerated (WBAT, usually without any undue discomfort, 50-90 % total body weight)
STEP TO, or STEP THROUGH, can be done with CRUTCHES OR WALKER
4 POINT GAIT – asynchronous
 4 full weightbearing points with 3-4 points of support on ground at all times
 1 aid advanced, then opposite LE advanced
 Can be done with bilateral crutches, canes, or walkers if FeWB
 Provides slow, stable gait
2 POINT GAIT – synchronous
 Similar to 4 point (4 full weightbearing points) but only 2 points of contact maintained at all times
 one leg and contralateral aid advance at same time
o ex. R cane and L leg together, then L cane and R leg together
 Can be done with bilateral crutches or canes
o Modified when only 1 crutch or cane is used
 Less stable, requires better balance
3 POINT GAIT
 3 points of support on floor
 NWB, FeWB or PWB (<80% can’t use CANE)
 Affected leg advanced, weight transferred to floor through aid via UE’s, then unaffected leg
advanced and weight returned to unaffected leg
 Can be done with crutches or a standard walker
 “Step-to” progressed to “step-through”
Neurodynamic techniques
125
 do not assess or treat if hard neurological signs
 do assess if peripheral conduction signs are present but be careful,
 do not treat is peripheral conduction signs are present
 CONTRAINDICATIONS:
o undiagnosed condition
o conditioning worsening
o severe irritably
o presence of hard neurological signs
 can do with both slump and SLR  PKB: tests L2-L4; SLR: L4/5-S2
 INITIAL TREATMENT  think sliders (both ends are moving) then go to tensioners (one side is not moving)
o start movement at remote area and indirect Rx (tx interface)
o then move proximal area with or without mobilization of interface
o go further into resistance, don’t provoke pain (just moderate stretch)
o add repetitions
Balance training/proprioceptive training
Sensory training  proper core and pelvic control?, start double leg support to single leg support, eyes opened and eyes
closed, on flat ground and on solid ground, increase levers, perturbations, whole body movement,
expected and anticipatory
(e.g., desensitization, protective education, sensory integration)
 desensitization  lots of education on how pain becomes chronic and how you get allodynia or
hyper/hypo-algesia
 talk to interprofessional team about medications (pharmacist)
 appropriate exercises that increase stimulus but not too rapidly or to cause more damage
 mirror therapy very good (CRPS, amputations)
 compression/support?
 start with soft fabrics, move to more rough fabrics to get sense to change of sensation, contrast baths
 stereognosis: sensory and motor integration
 WITH ALL: they need to watch, connect sensory and motor and make it salient for the individual
 JOINT PROTECTION: if amputation (see section), educate on areas where they may get injured, how to
change/modify movements or their set up
Mechanical agents (e.g., traction, continuous passive movement, compression garment and devices)
TRACTION:
- Separation of vertebral bodies, increased IVF diameter, mobilization of the z joints (distraction and gliding),
flattening of spinal curves, mechanoreceptor stimulation/pain inhibition, decreased muscle spasm, mobilization
of muscle and CT, improved circulation (blood and lymph)
- TYPES: manual, mechanical, traction using gravity, traction by positioning, autotraction
- INDICATIONS: joint dysfunction (hypomobility), degeneration (associated hypomobility), nerve root
compression or disc pathology, pain (effect on mechanoreceptor)
- CONTRAINDICATIONS: acute, patient can’t tolerate the traction position, bad response to manual traction,
recent surgery, underlying hypermobility or instability, malignancy, SSX of spinal cord or cauda equina
compression, vascular compromise additional for cervical: s&s VBI, TMJ dysfunction, RA, down syndrome,
cervical myelopathy, glaucoma,
- PRECAUTIONS: pregnancy, respiratory problems, osteoporosis, spondylolisthesis, hypermobility/instability,
claustrophobia, extremely restricted ROM, little improvement with rest
* ALWAYS CHECK VBI, NEUR TEST, NEUROMOBILITY AND CONDUCTION, STABILITY
- forces that are required are usually 10-20 % of body weight, do manual first then if good responses for 2-3
sessions then put on mechanical
COMPRESSION GARMENT: make sure proper fit, instruct patient to put on properly, ensure pressure is greater
distal then proximal, education on signs of too much pressure (cold, swelling, pain, capillary refill on toes 2-3
seconds normal?), instructed them to look for any wrinkles in garment to prevent pressure areas
ELECTROPHYSICAL AGENTS
126
Thermal agents
 Major source of heat gain = metabolism (also absorption of radiation from environment, etc.)
 Major source of heat loss = radiation (also exhalation, evaporation of sweat, urine)
 Heat: provides pain relief, reduces muscle spasm and joint stiffness, promotes relaxation, increases
blood flow, facilitates fine movement and increases ROM and exercise tolerance in some patients,
generally elevate tissues to 40-45° for therapeutic effect
 Cold: decreases swelling after injury/surgery, chronic edema and joint effusions, decreases muscle
spasm/spasticity, mild cooling enhances muscular isometric contraction and endurance, decrease pain
 Heat transfer: radiation (heat energy to electromagnetic radiation, ie. infra-red), convection
(movement of molecules in liquids or gases, ie. whirlpool), conduction (physical contact, ie. hot
packs/paraffin wax/contrast baths), conversion (chemical/electrical energy produces heat, ie.
US/diathermy)
 greatest effect in tissues at 1-2 mm, after that only about a 1°C change, if you want deeper you have to
wait 20-25 mins and you need short wave diathermy or prolonged thermal US
 BEFORE RX: test sensation (hot and cold)
 APPLICATION:
 paraffin (lower heat capacity, usually kept between 42- 52°): dip hands 6 times, will transmit heat as
it cools/solidifies, wrap in wax paper with glove, leave for 15 min
 hot pack: use 1-2 cm or 4-6 towel between skin and hot pack, takes ~8 min for skin to reach max
temp, do an objective and subjective test at 10 min, 15-20 mins duration, never lie on a hot pack
 contrast baths: increases blood flow to skin and provides considerable sensory stim (no real temp
change), tubs at 38-44° and 10-18°, ratio hot:cold = 4:2, 5:3, 3:1, etc. repeat 3-4x, 20-30 mins total
 whirlpool: mechanical stimulation + thermoreceptors (gating), can help with wound debridement
 CONTRAINDICATIONS: acute inflammation, skin conditions (dermatitis), altered thermal sensation,
hemorrhagic disease, malignancies, gonads, open wounds, unreliable patient
 APPLICATION:  check cap refill
o cold packs: don’t lie on, chip ice better then gel pack for cooling, 15 mins
o cryotherapy: monitoring this is key, can be more dangerous than ice
o local immersion: 15-20 mins
o ice towels: replace every 2-3 minutes, repeat up to 20 minutes
o ice massage: use on small area, dec local pain (5-10 minutes)
Check for allergic reaction to cold after 1 minute and again after 5 minutes
 Dangers/contraindications:
o ice burn
o peripheral nerve damage
o frostbite
o reduced peripheral blood supply (can further damage tissue)
o cold sensitivity (Reynaud’s, cold urticaria)
EMG feedback:
Why? Nerve conduction testing – estimates velocity of depolarization along an alpha motor neuron
 In skeletal muscle, normally silent at rest (short burst of electrical activity during needle insertion)
o Reduced insertional activity seen in fibrotic or severely atrophied muscle (when put needle in)
o Increased activity when a muscle is irritable
 Abnormal electrical activity at rest suggests neuropathy or myopathy and is indicated by fibrillation
potentials (rapid, irregular contractions of muscles), positive sharp waves, or fasciculation potentials
 Surface EMG – provides information about muscle activity (in order to up-train or down-train activity)
 Used to: improve control over defective muscles or improve control over stressed muscles (ex:
hemiplegia, SCI, spasticity, dystonia, recovering peripheral nerve injuries)
 Used as a tool not a treatment
TENS:
127
Why? Used for acute and chronic pain, muscle twitch, muscle strengthening and spasticity management
 segmental mechanism gating at spinal cord (conventional setting) OR extra-segmental mechanism
(release of opioid and serotonin receptors)
 Conventional: 80-150 Hz, 60 microseconds, intensity to comfortable tingle (modulated) with electrodes
over site of pain/bracketing, treatment duration 30 min, immediate pain management
 Acupuncture like: 10 Hz, 200 microseconds, intensity to muscle twitch, electrodes on motor point,
treatment duration 40-60 min, prolonged pain management
 Contraindications:
o electronic devices
o low back or ab of pregnant woman
o malignancy
o DVT or thromboembolism
o infected tissue (TB)
o impaired sensory awareness
o cognitive or communication impairments
o cardiac disease or arrhythmias
NMES:
Why? Can be used for pain, produce muscle twitch, inc muscle strength, spasticity management
 PAIN: settings for pain are like TENS
 EDEMA MNGT: over extraarticular edema, 5-10 Hz, 200 microseconds, motor intensity to twitch
 MUSCLES STRENGTHENING: >35<65 Hz, intensity to tetany, rise and fall (usually nice to have a 2 sec ramp
and 1 sec off with a 6 sec contraction = 9 sec total), on/off depending on strength of muscle (I: 1:5 III:
1:3 IV: 1:1) 12-15 contractions per second
 Contraindications:
o electrical devices/implant
o pregnancy ANYWHERE
o active DVT or thromboembolism
o infected tissue
o chest with cardiac disease or arrhythmias or heart failure
o neck or over eyes
o impaired circulation
o unstable (recent surgery, osteoporosis, #)
o intercostal muscles, lower abdomen
Interferential Current:
 WHY? Used for pain management via gating and/or endogenous opiate release, edema management
via muscle twitch, increasing local blood flow, muscle stimulation for strengthening of pelvic floor
 Low voltage, medium intensity, 2 sinusoidal waves – alternating current at 4000 Hz
o Each wave = slightly different frequencies and interfere with one another in tissues creating new
wave (linear super-position) that varies in shape, frequency, and amplitude
o Series of wave packets (beats)
 Balanced (won’t leave a charge in the skin), symmetrical, biphasic, amplitude modulated, pulse
duration 250 usec, phase duration 125 usec
 Motor = 1-10Hz with strong but comfortable muscle twitch  40-60 mins
 Sensory (pain) = 80-150Hz with strong but comfortable sensation  20-40 mins
 Motor + Sensory = 1-150 Hz for both (but less effective for motor)
 Application  quadripolar bracketing (bipolar if pre-modulated), warm/wet to decrease resistance,
sweep to avoid accommodation
o Can treat large, deep areas
 Caution
o can output 50-90mA (other machines = much lower) – NO THORACIC APPLICATION OVER 50mA
 Risk of ventricular fibrillation
o smaller electrodes increase current density and risk of burns
o superficial current flow and increased risk of burns if electrodes placed too close together
 CONTRAINDICATIONS:
128
o to the chest/thorax
o electronic devices (ie. pacemakers)
o regions of known or suspected malignancy
o low back or abdomen of pregnant women
o active DVT or thrombophlebitis
o actively bleeding tissues or untreated hemorrhagic disorders
o infected tissues, TB, or wounds with underlying osteomyelitis
o recently radiated tissue
o impaired sensory awareness
o to the neck or head (especially if known to have seizures)
o to areas near reproductive organs or genitalia (without specialized training)
o to areas near or over eyes
o damaged or at risk skin areas that would result in uneven conduction of current
o cognition or communication impairments (no feedback)
 Precautions:
o active epiphyses in children, skin disease (ie. eczema, psoriasis), impaired circulation, metal
implants, fragile skin (use vacuum/suction cup application)
HVPC:
High voltage, high peak intensity (current), low average intensity
 Monophasic (can build up a bigger net charge)
 Frequency = 1-200Hz, pulse width fixed (5-65microsec.), peak current is high (higher risk of burning), but
long interpulse interval so charge has a chance to dissipate allowing safer application (total current is
very low)
 MAINLY USED FOR: decreased pain, decreased edema, increased wound healing, muscle stim.
o (enhances oxygenation, blood flow and tissue formation)
 High voltage = more comfortable & large punch (better @punching away/bringing in molecules
 TX:
o PAIN = same parameters as and not any better than TENS
o WOUND HEALING = 50-100Hz (submotor), 30-60 mins, 3-7 days/wk, polarity based on stage of
healing
 macrophages/epidermal cells/epithelial cells all negative, fibroblasts positive
 one electrode in wound, one 10-20cm away
o (subacute) EDEMA REDUCTION = 5-20Hz (want twitch, usually start at negative polarity
 active red on edema (set as negative – pushes away +ve proteins) OR put it on muscle
twitch on motor point & nerve trunk (chronic)
o MUSCLE STIM = 35-65Hz,
 Galvanotaxis – can repel molecules or attract desired cells based on polarity
 CONTRAINDICATIONS:
o the usual
o transcranially
o person with cognitive or communication difficulty
o impaired circulation
o Inflammation (don’t want to add energy to injury)
IONTOPHORESIS –Rx method using current flow btw 2 electrodes to push ions through the skin barrier
 Current is direct current
 Positively charged drug can be made to cross the skin away from positive electrode (anode)
o under anode  possible acidic reaction  skin hardening over time (sclerotic)
o under cathode  possible alkaline reaction (softening and burning of skin)
 Keep the cathode larger (current density is therefore lower and skin is less likely to burn)
o MD ALWAYS PRESCRIBES THE DRUG!!!
 current density is limited to 1.0 mA/cm2 under anode and 0.5 mA/cm2 under cathode
 USED FOR:
129
o hyperhidrosis, MSK inflammatory disorders, plantar fasciitis, TMJ disorders, ischemic skin ulcer,
fungal infections, bursitis and tendonitis
 CONTRAINDICATIONS
o over damaged skin or open lesions
o allergy to therapeutic ions
o impaired sensation
o over electric implants
Electromagnetic energy agents
Short Wave Diathermy
 Therapeutically heat body tissues at any depth
 2 types of electromagnetic fields producing the heat (electrostatic and electromagnetic) –
o thermal and non-thermal effects
 Physiological effects of pulsed SWD: increased tissue healing, enhance nerve regeneration, pressure
ulcers, chronic low back pain, soft tissue injuries (some evidence it can be used for pain, muscle spasm,
chronic inflammation, delayed wound healing, chronic infection)
 2 main INDICATIONS FOR APPLICATION = OA and ankle sprain
 DOSAGE IS BASED ON
o Sensation  want moderate heat (20-30 min)
o Tissue healing phase
 Contraindications (main)  metallic implants & pacemakers (implanted devices),
cognitive/communication challenges
 Can get burns (unequal spacing, perspiration, etc.) – patient should just feel mild, comfortable warmth
LASER
 3 features of a laser:
o Monochromaticity (all photons have a single wavelength)
o Coherence (all photons travel in same phase and direction)
o Collimation (minimal divergence over distance)
 Used to increase tissue healing, decrease pain, decrease inflammation (wound management)
 Laser head: based on depth of lesion (red-near infrared = 1-5mm; near-mid infrared = 5-10mm)
 Dose: acute = 2J/per point, chronic = 4 J/per point (according to WALT guidelines)
 Frequency: acute <1000 kHz (wavelength 600-1000 nm), chronic >1000 kHz (wavelength 1000-1350 nm)
 Continuous or pulsed (laser lasts longer)
 Contact preferred over non-contact (scanning/grid)
 CONTRAINDICATIONS:
o Treatment of the eyes
o Known or suspected malignancy
o Low back or abdomen of pregnant women
o Hemorrhage or severe vascular disease
o Tissue infected by TB or virulent bacteria
o Actively bleeding tissues or untreated hemorrhagic disorders
o Active DVT or thrombophlebitis
o Reproductive tissues (testes)
 Precautions: recently radiated tissue, infected regions (compromised immune function), anterior neck,
photosensitive areas, cognitive impairments, epiphyseal plates in children
 BCCDC LASER Safety Guidelines
o Use in a controlled area
o Laser eye protection is required
o Only authorized personnel must occupy the area
o The area must have an appropriate warning sign
o Any windows, doorways, openings, etc. must be either covered or restricted
UV
130
 TREAT: psoriasis, eczema, vitiligo, pruritus (secondary to liver/kidney disease), acne, photodermatoses,
wound healing, atopic dermatitis
 Dosage based on MED: then start at 70% then work up by 5-10 % as tolerated (combo of UVB and UVA)
 CONTRAINDICATIONS = photosensitivity, skin cancer, and CT disorder (be aware of drugs causing
photosensitivity)
o On eyes  can cause conjunctivitis or photokeratitis (inflammation of cornea) – cataracts are
caused by chronic exposure to UV
Acoustic agents (e.g. ultrasound)
 Accelerates inflammatory phase to make it as efficient as possible
o Alters membrane permeability, releases “wound-healing” factors (ie. histamine, serotonin)
 Maintain contact and keep head moving and perpendicular to tissue
 Thermal effects: decreased pain, decreased joint stiffness, improved blood flow, promote healing
(decreases inflammation)
 Non-thermal effects: wound healing, inflammation and soft tissue healing, altered scar tissue formation,
stim of collagen synthesis, angiogenesis, repair of articular cartilage
 Parameters:
o frequency 1MHz (deep) and 3MHz (superficial)
o intensity
 inflammatory phase 0.1-0.5 W/cm2
 proliferation phase 0.5-0.8 W/cm2
 remodeling phase up to 2.5 W/cm2
o pulsed (acute) and continuous (chronic)
o acute = 5-20mins, less time for acute and more time for chronic
o pulse ratio: 1:8  1:1  continuous
 Apply to area not larger than 2-2.5xERA (ERA = area producing 5% or more of max. power output –
higher = better) -
 CONTRAINDICATIONS:
o implantable devices (ie. pacemaker, Medtronic stimulation system)
o abdomen and pelvis if pregnant
o malignancy
o bleeding disorder
o acute sepsis or infection
o TB of lungs or bone
o active DVT or thrombophlebitis
o myositis ossificans
o fracture
o impaired circulation or sensation
o pelvis and lumbar spine if menstruating
o radiotherapy (not for 6 months)
o gonads
o abscess
o areas of acute inflammation (if using continuous as it generates heat)
 PRECAUTIONS: spinal cord or superficial nerves, regenerating nerves, epiphyseal plate unfused, implants
(metal OK if using pulsed US)
Protective, adaptive, or assistive devices (e.g., tape, splints, orthotics, prostheses)
Tape: used for proprioceptive feedback, warning to stay out of posture, to maintain biomechanical gains of
treatment, provide external stability; always check allergies to tape/product, keep on for 2-3 days then take
off, take off if increases pain, red, itchy, etc.
Splint: as above, use more in acute phase or prophylactically for return to play
Orthotics: used as support for structure or off loading, are the imbalances or biomechanical faults flexible or
static? Can they be corrected with exercises?
