Social media is being used more and more to promote clinics and therapists.
• There are no restrictions that prevent a clinic or therapist from linking their site to a 3rd party
site such as TikTok, Instagram, or Facebook.
• Therapists can endorse a product but only if there is evidence to support the product's use,
the use is within their scope of practice, and it is done in a professional manner (i.e., there is no
conflict of interest).
• Therapists cannot financially gain from endorsing a product.
• Testimonials and ratings on the clinic's website and 3rd party sites are allowed but must be
given by the free will of the patient. No benefits or rewards can be given for a review.
Discounts
Advertised discounted or bundled services must abide by the following rules:
• The advertisement must state that if a bundle price is offered, the patient is still able to
purchase single rate sessions and if the entire bundle is not used, refunds can be provided for
unused services.
• For example: if a follow-up treatment costs $100, a bundle may be offered with 3
sessions for $280 ($20 savings).
• It is important to ensure that you are providing the same quality of treatment that you would
for a patient paying full price.
QUESTION 1 OF 7
Vignette: A new physiotherapy clinic is trying to attract new patients by offering a
bundle package for their sessions which equates to a 15% savings over 10 sessions.
Question: Which of the following is false regarding discounted prices for
packaged/bundled services?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Discounted prices for packaged/bundled services must clearly state that there are
still options to purchase single sessions.
B The standard of care provided cannot be of lesser quality because of the
packaged/bundled services.
When offering discounted prices for packaged/bundles services, refunds must be
provided for any unused services.
D Discounted prices for packaged/bundled services cannot exceed 10 sessions to
avoid any conflicts of interest.
This a n s w e r i s correct.
A. Discounted prices for packaged/bundled services must clearly state that there are still
options to purchase single sessions.
• This is a true statement.
B. The standard of care provided cannot be of lesser quality because of the
packaged/bundled services.
• This is a true statement.
C. When offering discounted prices for packaged/bundles services, refunds must be provided
for any unused services.
• This is a true statement.
D. Discounted prices for packaged/bundled services cannot exceed 10 sessions to avoid any
conflicts of interest. - Best answer
• This is a false statement.
• There are no regulations regarding the number of sessions that can be included in a
packaged/bundled.
Vignette: A new graduate physiotherapist has recently been hired by a private practice
orthopedic clinic that employs several therapists that have a special interest in
dizziness and vestibular conditions. The new graduate is hoping to receive vestibular
mentoring at the clinic and plans to take some post graduate courses. The clinic owner
has requested that the physiotherapist participate in an Instagram post to highlight
their new position and requests that the physiotherapist mention that they now work
at the best clinic in the Vancouver area. They would like the physiotherapist to also
include that the clinic has over 99% success rate treating any and all vestibular related
conditions.
Question: Which of the following is the most ethical way for the physiotherapist to
proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Do as the owner requests and put up the Instagram story because the clinic is
known to have a great reputation.
Refuse to post an Instagram story.
Agree to post an Instagram story but agree to only highlight their new position at
the clinic.
D Request to use Facebook instead to post about their new position and the clinic's
success rate as Instagram is not the best platform to use for advertisements.
This a n s w e r i s c o r r e c t .
A. Do as the owner requests and put up the Instagram story because the clinic is known to
have a great reputation.
• The physiotherapist should not post what the owner is requesting as it is their duty to
ensure advertisements are true and accurate.
• The owner is asking the physiotherapist to guarantee treatment results (by stating that
there is a 99% success rate) and that their clinic is superior to others (by stating they
are the best clinic in the area, both of which are not allowed.
B. Refuse to post an Instagram story.
• This answer is not wrong, however, it is not the best answer.
C. Agree to post an Instagram story but agree to only highlight their new position at the
clinic. - Best answer
• This is the best answer as it helps to bring awareness and advertisement to the clinic
without including any false or inaccurate statements.
• Using social media (Facebook, Instagram etc.) is a great marketing strategy for clinics
and physiotherapists, but needs to be used in an ethical manner.
D. Request to use Facebook instead to post about their new position and the clinic's success
rate as Instagram is not the best platform to use for advertisements.
• The type of platform used does not change the fact that the owner wants the
physiotherapist to post in an unethical manner.
This a n s w e r i s correct.
A. Physiotherapists cannot ask patients to leave reviews on any social media platform.
• This is a false statement.
• Requesting a review/rating from a patient is allowed as long as the patient is not
coerced or bribed to leave a good review.
B. Physiotherapists can only ask patients to leave reviews on their professional website.
• This is a false statement.
• Physiotherapists can request reviews/ratings on any social media platform.
C. The use of reviews can only be used if they are given freely by patients without any
prompting.
• This is a false statement.
• Physiotherapists can prompt/request that a patient leave a review as long as the
patient is not coerced or bribed to leave the review.
D. Physiotherapy clinics and/or the physiotherapists themselves can requests that patients
leave a review. - Best answer
• This is a true statement.
• Many organizations send out automatic emails to patients asking for reviews which
means that the request for a review does not always come directly from the treating
therapist.
Vignette: A physiotherapist has just started at a new private practice clinic. They are in
the process of becoming certified in acupuncture but have not yet finished all of their
courses and the examination process to qualify. The owner has created business cards
for the new physiotherapist which includes 'Certified by the Acupuncture Foundation
of Canada Institute (CAFCI)' next to their title.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Report the owner to the College.
Use the business cards but refrain from using acupuncture during the treatment
sessions.
Ask the owner to put those business cards aside until officially certified.
D Remove the business cards from the front desk.
This a n s w e r i s correct.
A. Report the owner to the College.
• This is not the first step in this scenario.
• Reporting to the College would be required if the owner insisted that the
physiotherapist use the business cards and falsely advertise their current
qualifications.
B. Use the business cards but refrain from using acupuncture during the treatment sessions.
The physiotherapist is not yet certified in acupuncture and should therefore not use
acupuncture during their treatment sessions or use those credentials or business
cards.
C. Ask the owner to put those business cards aside until officially certified.
• The physiotherapist is not yet certified in acupuncture and should therefore not use
those credentials or business cards.
• The physiotherapist needs to take responsibility and ask the owner to put those
business cards aside and wait to use them once they have become officially certified.
D. Remove the business cards from the front desk.
• While this is not wrong, it is not the best answer.
• The physiotherapist needs to communicate the issue with the owner so that the issue
is known and properly managed. Simply removing the cards from the front desk may
not stop them from being circulated or replaced at the front desk.
Vignette: A new physiotherapy clinic has opened, and the owner has linked the clinic
to Facebook and Instagram for advertisement purposes. A local sporting goods store
has made a request to start a promotion with the clinic. They suggest that if the
physiotherapy clinic mentions their fitness equipment in their social media posts, the
clinic can get a discount on gym equipment.
Question: How should the clinic owner respond to this request?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Accept the request as it is mutually beneficial.
Accept the request but only mention fitness equipment that is related to the
physiotherapy profession.
Decline the request as the clinic cannot endorse products.
D Decline the request as the clinic cannot financially gain from endorsing products.
This a n s w e r i s correct.
A. Accept the request as it is mutually beneficial.
• This is not ethical.
Clinics/therapists cannot financially gain from endorsing a product.
B. Accept the request but only mention fitness equipment that is related to the
physiotherapy profession.
• This is not ethical.
• Clinics/therapists cannot financially gain from endorsing a product.
C. Decline the request as the clinic cannot endorse products.
• Physiotherapists and physiotherapy clinics can advertise/endorse products if it is done
professionally.
• They can do so if there is evidence to support the product's use, the use is within their
scope of practice, and there is no conflict of interest.
• The conflict of interest in this scenario is the financial gain that comes from endorsing
the gym equipment.
D. Decline the request as the clinic cannot financially gain from endorsing products. - Best
a n s w e r
• In this scenario, advertising fitness equipment is within the physiotherapy scope of
practice, but the clinic and physiotherapists have a conflict of interest because they are
getting a financial discount by endorsing the gym equipment.
Vignette: A patient purchased a 10-session bundle several months ago after injuring
their back in the garden. After 6 treatments, the patient is feeling significantly better.
While the patient is feeling better, the physiotherapist still feels that there are more
gains to be made and ongoing strengthening would help to prevent future injury. The
patient insists they would like to stop sessions.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Insist the patient to use their remaining 4 sessions.
Educate the patient on why they feel ongoing physiotherapy is beneficial.
Discharge the patient and provide a home exercise program.
D Reassess the patient using outcome measures to determine if they are truly ready
for discharge.
This a n s w e r is correct.
A. Insist the patient to use their remaining 4 sessions.
• This is not the best answer as it is not reflecting a client-centered approach.
B. Educate the patient on why they feel ongoing physiotherapy is beneficial. - Best answer
• This is the best answer because educating the patient will allow them to make an
informed decision about their health choices. The patient may not realize the ongoing
benefits of physiotherapy.
• Regardless of the patient's final decision, the physiotherapist must respect that
decision but ensure they have provided the patient with all the information necessary
to make an informed decision.
• The physiotherapist should also document the interaction and plan of action.
C. Discharge the patient and provide a home exercise program.
While this answer is not wrong, it is not the best answer as the physiotherapist should
first educate the patient to ensure they are making an informed decision regarding
their health.
D. Reassess the patient using outcome measures to determine if they are truly ready for
discharge.
• The patient gets to decide if they want to continue treatment or not, regardless of
whether the physiotherapist thinks they are ready or not based on outcome measures.
• While outcome measures are important and could provide helpful information,
education is the best answer in this scenario.
Vignette: A patient purchased a 10-session bundle several months ago after injuring
their back in the garden. After 6 treatments, the patient is feeling significantly better.
While the patient is feeling better, the physiotherapist still feels that there are more
gains to be made and ongoing strengthening would help to prevent future injury. The
patient insists they would like to stop sessions.
Question: How should the physiotherapist manage the unused sessions provided in
t h e b u n d l e ?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Offer the patient a refund for unused services.
Allow the patient to keep the unused appointments on file for future use.
Provide an option for a refund but only if this policy was put in writing when the
bundle was purchased.
D A and B
This a n s w e r i s correct.
A. Offer the patient a refund for unused services.
B. Allow the patient to keep the unused appointments on file for future use.
C. Provide an option for a refund but only if this policy was put in writing when the bundle
was purchased.
• The policy of offering refunds for unused services should always be included when
advertising bundled packages.
D. A and B - Best answer
• This is the best option as it gives the patient the choice of how they want to use the
remaining sessions.
• The physiotherapist should offer the patient a refund for unused services OR allow
them to keep the unused appointments on file for future use if they should choose to
use them later.
• The physiotherapist should document the discussion and plan.
Collaboration with the patient and other health care practitioners
Collaboration is critical when working with a patient to help them reach their goals.
• What does patient collaboration look like?
• Work with the patient to create a care plan that is unique to them and their goals.
• Ensure the patient understands their treatment options and care plan.
- How long do you expect their treatment plan to be?
- How many sessions do you think they will need? How often?
• Empower the patient to learn how they can become involved in their own care and help
them make informed decisions about their care.
• Respect the patient's decisions about their care plan.
• For example:
• They do not want to work with a PTA.
• They could benefit from 3x/week but would only like to attend 1x/week due
to financial reasons.
• Decline hands on treatment and only would like exercise based therapy.
• What does collaboration with other health care practitioners look like?
• If you do not feel you are able to provide a certain treatment, ensure you make the
appropriate referral to involve another provider in their care, with the consent of your
patient.
• It is your responsibility to understand what other services are provided in your
community so you are able to make the correct referral if necessary.
Communication within t h e circle of care
Health care professionals are often required to communicate with others when delivering care.
There are times when a physiotherapist can assume implied consent to communicate with another
health care provider within their patient's circle of care (i.e., they do not need to explicitly ask
permission from the patient to communicate with that individual).
In order to share personal health information with another health care provider without the
patient's consent, the following conditions must be met:
• You must be communicating with a health information custodian (HIC) or agent of a HIC (see
Privacy for the definition of a HIC).
• You are communicating for the purpose of providing health care to the patient.
• The patient has not revoked consent to communicate with the health care professional.
For example, during hospital rounds, health care providers are not required to ask for the patient's
consent to share information about their patient assessment/interactions. The team is
communicating about the patient for the purpose of providing effective care.
This can, however, become a lot more blurred when moving into a private practice setting. It is less
clear who is currently working with the patient (i.e., who is in the circle of care). Also, the patient may
be working with another health care professional but receiving treatment for something completely
different.
For this reason, when communicating with other health care providers in a private practice setting, it
is always best to first obtain consent from the patient (or their substitute decision-maker) rather
than simply relying on implied consent.
On the exam, when it comes to communication with other health care workers, the best answer will
always be one that includes gaining consent prior to disclosing your patient's personal information.
Issues during collaborative care
If you feel you are not able to collaborate with the patient for any reason, you should do your best to
arrive at a solution.
Suggested strategies:
• Talk with the patient and any other clinicians involved to ensure everyone is on the same page.
• If treatment is planned to continue, document the situation and the plan for moving forward.
• If treatment is planned to discontinue, provide an alternative treatment option through
referral to another health-care provider/ physical therapist, if the therapeutic relationship is
compromised. Document the situation.
Vignette: A patient is attending physiotherapy at a private clinic for treatment of
whiplash following a car accident 3 months ago. They attend the appointment with
their spouse. While taking the patient's history, the spouse often interjects and gives
additional information pertaining to the injury. The patient seems frustrated, but is
able to provide a thorough history. Before beginning treatment, the physiotherapist
obtains the patient's informed consent.
Question: During your assessment the patient states that they have been very nervous
to drive since their accident. They state that they would like to try counselling but are
unsure if they will like it. The clinic has a counsellor and the physiotherapist thinks
they would be a great fit for this patient. How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Advise the patient that there is a reliable counsellor who works at the clinic who
would be a great fit.
B Provide the patient with a list of local services, including the counsellor who
works at the clinic.
Liaise with the counsellor at the clinic and ask them to reach out to the patient to
educate them on what counselling will involve and if it is a good fit for them.
D Send a recommendation to their family doctor for counselling and ask the patient
to follow up with them immediately.
A. Advise the patient that there is a reliable counsellor who works at the clinic who would be
a great fit.
• A list must be provided rather than one option.
B. Provide the patient with a list of local services, including the counsellor who works at the
clinic. - Best answer
• Referring to other community services does not require a doctor's referral; however,
the physiotherapist must provide the patient with choice and this is done through
giving them a list of potential counsellors.
C. Liaise with the counsellor at the clinic and ask them to reach out to the patient to educate
them on what counselling will involve and if it is a good fit for them.
• In order to talk to the counsellor at the clinic, the physiotherapist would have to obtain
consent from their patient.
D. Send a recommendation to their family doctor for counselling and ask the patient to
follow up with them immediately.
• The patient does not need a referral from their family physician to obtain community
counselling service. However, it is recommended that the physiotherapy update their
family doctor that a referral has been made.
Vignette: A physiotherapist is working with a 65-year-old patient who has been
suffering from low back pain for several months. During the initial assessment, the
patient informs the physiotherapist that their pain is constant and present at night.
They have also lost around 15 pounds without any change in their diet. They are eager
to improve their pain through exercise so they can return to their regular daily exercise
routine at the community gym.
Question: What is the best course of action?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Send the patient to emergency and inform them that you are concerned they may
h a v e cancer.
Carry out the rest of the physical assessment and advise the patient that you are
concerned there is something more sinister going on.
Finish the assessment and then ask the patient to follow up with their family
physician within the next few days.
Advise the patient that you will be referring them back to their family physician.
A. Send the patient to emergency and inform them that you are concerned they may have
c a n c e r.
• While this patient is presenting with some hallmarks signs of cancer (night pain,
constant pain, weight loss), it is beyond the physiotherapist's scope of practice to
diagnose a patient with cancer.
• While more follow up and investigations are required, it is also not necessary to send
the patient to the emergency room in this situation.
B. Carry out the rest of the physical assessment and advise the patient that you are
concerned there is something more sinister going on.
• While this is correct, it is not the best answer because it does not highlight the need for
collaborative practice which is the referral back to their family physician for more
investigations.
C. Finish the assessment and then ask the patient to follow up with their family physician
within the next few days.
• Asking a patient to follow up with their family physician does not guarantee that they
will.
• If cancer red flags are suspected, the physiotherapist must communicate and/or refer
the patient back to their family physician so more investigations can be made.
D. Advise the patient that you will be referring them back to their family physician. - Best
a n s w e r
• This is the best answer as it highlights the need for a referral back to the family
physician for more investigations.
• Identifying red flags and referring back to a physician (or emergency if necessary - e.g.
suspected cauda equina) is a critical part of patient care and a great example of the
importance of collaborative practice.
QUESTION 5 OF 6
Vignette: A physiotherapist is working in a local hospital. The occupational therapist
on their ward asks them to go and assess a new patient who has just arrived.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
A s s e s s a n d t r e a t t h e p a t i e n t a s a n a l l i e d h e a l t h m e m b e r h a s r e q u e s t e d t h e
assessment.
Assess the patient but wait for a formal referral to initiate treatment.
Wait for a formal referral to assess and/or treat the patient.
D Review the patient's record and make an informed decision as to whether the
patient requires physiotherapy services.
This a n s w e r i s c o r r e c t .
A. Assess and treat the patient as an allied health member has requested the assessment.
• In this situation, the physiotherapist would need a referral to assess and/or treat this
patient.
• The referral must come from a physician or nurse practitioner.
B. Assess the patient but wait for a formal referral to initiate treatment.
• In this situation, the physiotherapist would need a referral to assess and/or treat this
patient.
• A referral is not required for a physiotherapy assessment and treatment outside of a
hospital (e.g., private practice setting). However, a referral may be required to cover
some third-party payers (e.g., extended health plan, coverage for a car or work-related
injury)
• A referral is required for a physiotherapy assessment and treatment within a hospital
setting or when receiving government-funded (publicly funded) physiotherapy.
C. Wait for a formal referral to assess and/or treat the patient. - Best answer
• This is the best answer.
• Because the patient is in hospital receiving publicly funded services, the
physiotherapist must wait for a referral to assess and/or treat the patient.
D. Review the patient's record and make an informed decision as to whether the patient
requires physiotherapy services.
• Given that the patient is not within your circle of care and a referral has not been given,
you should not be reviewing their chart records.
Vignette: A physiotherapist is treating a patient in a private practice multidisciplinary
clinic setting. The patient sustained a traumatic brain injury 2 years ago that resulted
in ataxia. The patient has been working on ambulation and general strengthening. The
tient lets the physiotherapist know that they are also working with an occupational
erapist at a different private clinic.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
A Encourage the patient to see the occupational therapist at their office.
B Carry on with the treatment plan as the patient has the right to see other health
care practitioners.
Consult with the occupational therapist to determine if some of the strengthening
exercises in the program could be catered towards improving an ADL that the
patient is having difficulty with.
D Gain consent to liaise with the occupational therapist.
A. Encourage the patient to see the occupational therapist at their office.
• The patient does not need to see the occupational therapist at the physiotherapist's
office.
• It is also unethical to request that the patient only receive services at their clinic - the
patient should always be provided with options.
• If the patient was looking for a new occupational therapist, the physiotherapist could
provide a list of options including the occupational therapist at their own office.
B. Carry on with the treatment plan as the patient has the right to see other health care
practitioners.
• While the patient is allowed to see other health care practitioners, this is not the best
answer as the patient will benefit from collaboration between the physiotherapist and
occupational therapist.
C. Consult with the occupational therapist to determine if some of the strengthening
exercises in the program could be catered towards improving an ADL that the patient is
having difficulty with.
• Physiotherapists are encouraged to consult and collaborate with other health care
workers to maximize patient outcomes.
• However, option D is the best answer because it discusses the first step of action which
would be to gain consent to communicate with the occupational therapist.
D. Gain consent to liaise with the occupational therapist. - Best answer
• While the occupational therapist is a health information custodian working within the
patient's circle of care, it is always best to first obtain consent from the patient to
communicate rather than simply relying on implied consent.
Vignette: A patient is attending physiotherapy at a private clinic for treatment of
whiplash following a car accident 3 months ago. They attend the appointment with
their spouse. While taking the patient's history, the spouse often interjects and gives
additional information pertaining to the injury. The patient seems frustrated, but is
able to provide a thorough history. Before beginning treatment, the physiotherapist
obtains the patient's informed consent.
Question: After 3 weeks of therapy, the patient states that they have started seeing
another physiotherapist down from where they live. How should the physiotherapist
proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Discharge the patient as they are now seeing a physiotherapist closer to home.
Advise the patient against seeing multiple practitioners as the different therapies
could potentially conflict.
Gain information on why the patient is seeing another physiotherapist.
D Continue to treat the patient knowing it is within their right to work with multiple
health care practitioners at the same time.

C Gain information on why the patient is seeing another physiotherapist.
D Continue to treat the patient knowing it is within their right to work with multiple
health care practitioners at the same time.
A. Discharge the patient as they are now seeing a physiotherapist closer to home.
• While discharging the patient may be appropriate if they can receive services closer to
home, the patient may benefit from ongoing services if the two therapists are able to
provide different services that are complementary to one another.
B. Advise the patient against seeing multiple practitioners as the different therapies could
potentially conflict.
• This is not the best answer as patients can see two different physiotherapists.
• To avoid any conflicts, the physiotherapist should ensure the patient is benefiting from
seeing two different practitioners and the therapist are complimentary and do not
overlap.
C. Gain information on why the patient is seeing another physiotherapist. - Best answer
• While a patient can see two different physiotherapists, it would be important to
determine why the patient has introduced another physiotherapist into their
rehabilitation.
• Based on the patient's rationale, the physiotherapist could then formulate a plan to
best serve the patient.
• For example, if the patient is seeing the other physiotherapist because they are
closer to their home, then discharging the patient from services may be the best
option.
• If, however, the patient is seeing the other physiotherapist for additional services
that compliment their current program (e.g., acupuncture), then it would be
important for the two physiotherapists to consult and collaborate with one
another to ensure their approaches are complementary and do not conflict or
overlap.
• After understanding the rational behind the decision, the physiotherapist should gain
consent to liaise with the other physiotherapist.
D. Continue to treat the patient knowing it is within their right to work with multiple health
• After understanding the rational behind the decision, the physiotherapist should gain
consent to liaise with the other physiotherapist.
D. Continue to treat the patient knowing it is within their right to work with multiple health
care practitioners at the same time.
• While it is within the patient's right to see two different physiotherapists, it is the
physiotherapist's responsibility to ensure the patient is benefiting from seeing two
different practitioners and the therapist are complimentary and do not overlap.
Vignette: A physiotherapist is working in a private practice clinic. They are treating a
patient who suffered a traumatic brain injury. The patient has a very complex case, and
the physiotherapist requires a multidisciplinary approach to optimize their care. The
physiotherapist feels that the patient would benefit from a consult with a local
physiatrist for spasticity management.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Directly refer the patient to a reputable local physiatrist.
B Liaise with the patient's family physician and have the physician put in a referral
for a physiatry consult.
C Provide the patient with a list of physiatrists in the area.
D Ask the patient to liaise with their family physician to determine if a physiatry
consult will be of benefit.
This a n s w e r i s correct.
A. Directly refer the patient to a reputable local physiatrist.
• Physiotherapist cannot directly refer a patient to see a specialist such as a physiatrist.
B. Liaise with the patient's family physician and have the physician put in a referral for a
physiatry consult. - Best answer
• Physiotherapist cannot directly refer a patient to see a specialist such as a physiatrist.
• Our role here would be to send that recommendation to the family physician so that
the appropriate referral can be made.
C. Provide the patient with a list of physiatrists in the area.
• Physiotherapist cannot directly refer a patient to see a specialist such as a physiatrist.
D. Ask the patient to liaise with their family physician to determine if a physiatry consult will
be of benefit.
• The physiotherapist should be the one to liaise with the family physician, not the
patient.
• Collaboration and consultation with other health care members is an important part of
delivering effective patient care.
Outcomes associated with good communication
Physiotherapists must ensure they communicate effectively with their patients to ensure the
following:
• Informed consent (the patient understands the proposed treatment).
• Improved history taking, diagnosis and clinical decisions.
• Increased adherence to physiotherapy recommendations.
• Improved self-management of chronic conditions.
• Improved implementation of preventative behaviours.
• Improved patient satisfaction and experience of care.
Key components to good communication
The work of communication is key to creating a therapeutic alliance. It is a simple but significant
behavior. Key components to good communication include:
Using of proper greetings such as using their correct pronouns, preferred name or title.
• Respecting privacy requests, such as having their initial assessment conducted in a private
room.
• Explaining in layman's terms what they can expect during treatment.
• Allowing the patient time to ask questions and taking time to confirm that they understand.
• The use of paraphrasing is helpful!
• Learning about cultural beliefs and respecting these beliefs while treating patients.
• Aligning expectations to ensure you are working towards a mutual goal.
• Avoiding making assumptions - ask questions to clarify what the patient is saying if there is
confusion.
• Using a translator, google translate and/or family member when the patient and
physiotherapist do not speak the same language.
Strategies to improve non-verbal communication:
• Appear tidy and professional.
• Take pauses and use head nods to show interest.
• Keep facial expressions appropriate for the situation.
• Keep your body in an open position (for example, keep arms and legs uncrossed).
Scenario specific communication strategies
Common scenarios where the ability to therapeutically communicate is affected:
• Aphasia
• Dementia or Alzheimer's
• Poor English skills
Aphasia
• Decrease background noises.
• Ensure you have the patient's attention.
• Keep communication simple using 1 step commands.
• Allow more time for the patient to respond to you.
• Make sure you are making eye contact and are at eye level.
Global aphasia: The patient is not able to understand what you are saying nor can they communicate
verbally.
• Communicate with each other using demonstrations, gestures, images and body language.
• Use the help of family members.
• Ask them to let you know if the patient has any routine body language or facial
expressions they use to communicate.
Expressive aphasia: The patient can understand what you are saying, but cannot communicate
verbally.
Expressive aphasia: The patient can understand what you are saying, but cannot communicate
verbally.
• Encourage the patient to...
• Use gestures (thumbs up, thumbs down, head nod)
• D e m o n s t r a t e
• Point to objects or pictures
• Use facial expressions
• As a therapist, you can...
• Use general aphasia strategies above
• Speak slowly
Receptive aphasia: The patients can communicate verbally but verbal skills are often poor so what
they say may not make sense. They cannot understand what you are saying verbally.
• Encourage the patient to...
• Speak slowly
• They can also use the techniques the therapist uses below as their verbal speech is often
disorganized and hard to understand.
• As a therapist, you can...
• Use gestures (thumbs up, thumbs down, head nod)
• D e m o n s t r a t e
• Point to objects or pictures
Dementia or Alzheimer's
• Avoid making assumptions about the patient's cognitive abilities.
• Dementia symptoms can fluctuate, and the severity of dementia can vary.
• Ask your patient how they prefer to communicate (verbal, visual, written, or
nonverbal/actions).
• Move slowly.
• Get eye level.
• Gain their trust.
• Be patient and give the patient time to speak.
• Gain their interest in participating.
• Ask them what they like to do!
• Limit distractions.
• Find a quiet space for your session.
• If necessary, use clear single-step instructions.
• If necessary, use gestures, demonstrations, and visual cues instead of a lot of talking.
• If necessary, use hand over hand to assist with movement if necessary.
• If applicable, make the task functional.
• If your patient won't perform AROM when asked, ask them to reach for an object to see
their AROM.
• If necessary, use yes or no questions.
• Avoid aiming for perfection!
Poor english skills
• The best option is to use an interpreter to facilitate accurate communication.
• Even if a family member is there, you want to ensure accurate translation occurs, so
finding an interpreter would be best.
• Urban hospitals often have interpreters available.
• If an interpreter is not available, use a co-worker, or another health care professional who
speaks the patient's language.
• If you cannot use another health care professional, use a family member or google translate.
• Pay close attention to the patient to see if they appear uncomfortable or unwilling to
participate. If it appeared that accurate information was not being translated between
the family member and patient, wait for an interpreter.
• Use other non-verbal communication strategies such as:
• Gestures (thumbs up, thumbs down, head nod)
• D e m o n s t r a t i o n s
• Pointing to objects or pictures
• Drawing on a drawing board
• Using facial expressions
Vignette: A 38-year-old male patient is attending physiotherapy at a private clinic for
treatment of post concussion syndrome following a car accident 4 months ago. His
wife attends most sessions and plays an active role in his care. During the initial
assessment, the patient provided consent for his wife to be involved in all
conversations regarding their care. The patient is suffering from chronic headaches,
visual disturbances, balance issues and fatigue. He is currently not working because
his job, as a construction worker, is very strenuous.
Question: During the third session, the patient's wife states that she wants her
husband t o return t o work within t h e next week because he is t h e main financial
contributor of the household. How should the physiotherapist address this?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Educate the patient and his spouse about the injury and the current concerns
regarding return to work and discuss a more realistic return to work plan.
To avoid upsetting the patient, have a private conversation with the spouse about
the nature of the injury and more realistic expectations for recovery.
Explain to the patient and their spouse that counselling may be beneficial.
D Discuss a gradual return to work plan with the patient and their spouse.
A. Educate the patient and his spouse about the injury and the current concerns regarding
return to work and discuss a more realistic return to work plan. - Best answer
• Education will be critical to ensure the patient and their spouse understand the
realistic timeline for return to work.
B. To avoid upsetting the patient, have a private conversation with the spouse about the
nature of the injury and more realistic expectations for recovery.
• Having private conversations about the patient with their spouse does not respect the
client's privacy or include them in the management of the unrealistic expectations
being set upon them.
C. Explain to the patient and their spouse that counselling may be beneficial.
• This answer does not address the unrealistic expectations being set upon the patient
by their spouse. Educate is required to ensure there is an understanding of why the
patient is not ready to return to work.
D. Discuss a gradual return to work plan with the patient and their spouse.
• Gradual return to work will be critical, but this answer is missing the most important
element required which is education on the condition, expected recovery and timeline
to return to work.
A. Immediately confront the client and tell her that her behaviour is not acceptable, and she
needs to stop interrupting the class.
• The physiotherapist has every right to ask the participant to stop interrupting the class
but does need to do so in a respectful manner.
B. Advise the client that we'd love to hear the story, but ask that she tells it after the class has
finished. - Best answer
• This is the best answer as it redirects the attention back to the physiotherapist in a
respectful manner.
• Sharing birth stories is a powerful healing tool. In this situation, the vignette states that
the story is disruptive to the class and therefore the best path forward would be to
kindly ask the patient to tell their story outside of class time.
C. Try to divert the story teller's attention by telling a joke or interrupting their story.
• While this is not wrong, it is not the best answer as it does not provide a clear solution
to the problem.
D. Allow the client to tell her story and listen attentively as her story is meaningful to the
group.
• It is important that the physiotherapist take the lead and direct the class to ensure that
everyone who is participating is getting the most out of the course. Not all participants
may want to listen to other's stories and may prefer to focus on the session content.
Vignette: A 75-year-old patient was referred to physiotherapy by her daughter due to
balance issues and frequent falls. The patient speaks Mandarin but is non-English
speaking. The physiotherapist is part of a mobile clinic and will perform the initial
assessment and follow up treatments in the patient's home. Her daughter was
planning on attending the session as the interpreter.
Question: The physiotherapist arrives at a patient's home for the initial in-home
assessment. Upon arrival, the physiotherapy notices that the patient is home alone
and the daughter is not present. How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Wait for the daughter to arrive and, if she does not arrive within a few minutes, the
physiotherapist can leave a note with the patient informing the daughter that they
were unable to perform the assessment due to the language barrier.
Begin the assessment using gestures and pictures to aid in communication.
Wait several minutes for the daughter to arrive and, if she does not arrive, begin
the assessment using google translate.
D Call the daughter and gain consent to begin the assessment.
This a n s w e r i s correct.
A. Wait for the daughter to arrive and, if she does not arrive within a few minutes, the
physiotherapist can leave a note with the patient informing the daughter that they were
unable to perform the assessment due to the language barrier.
• Leaving without performing the assessment is not the best use of the physiotherapist's
time and does not assist the patient in any way.
• There are other options, such as google translate, that can be used to ensure accurate
communication and allow the physiotherapist to begin the assessment while gaining
informed consent.
B. Begin the assessment using gestures and pictures to aid in communication.
• The use of gestures and pictures can aid be a helpful communication strategy, but they
do not guarantee an understanding of the proposed treatment and is thus not the best
a n s w e r .
C. Wait several minutes for the daughter to arrive and, if she does not arrive, begin the
assessment using google translate. - Best answer
• The use of google translate is an excellent option to ensure clear communication and
gain informed consent.
D. Call the daughter and gain consent to begin the assessment.
• It is the patient that must consent to treatment, not the daughter.
Vignette: A physiotherapist enters a room in the emergency department to provide
treatment to a 70-year-old with a mild case of pneumonia. The patient does not speak
English and has one family member present who speaks minimal English. Their chart
states the patient is fluent in Punjabi. The physiotherapist wants to perform an initial
assessment and then help get the patient mobilizing as this is in the patient's best
interest to prevent any pulmonary complications.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Begin the assessment and use pointing and gestures to aid the communication.
Wait to perform the assessment and find an interpreter to facilitate accurate
communication.
Begin the assessment and use the family member to help translate as well as non-
verbal communication strategies such as gestures and drawings.
Wait to perform the assessment and refer the patient to another staff member
who speaks Punjabi.
This answer is incorrect. The correct answer is 'B'.
A. Begin the assessment and use pointing and gestures to aid the communication.
• A language barrier can make it difficult for the patient to understand the proposed
treatment and its risks. Because they may not fully understand what the
physiotherapist is saying, they cannot provide informed consent.
• For this reason, the physiotherapist should not start the assessment until accurate
communication occurs and informed consent is provided.
B. Wait to perform the assessment and find an interpreter to facilitate accurate
communication. - Best answer
• The best option is to use an interpreter to facilitate accurate communication.
C. Begin the assessment and use the family member to help translate as well as non-verbal
communication strategies such as gestures and drawings.
• A family member can be used to aid in interpreting, except the family member in this
scenario does not speak fluent English so it would be difficult to ensure accurate
communication.
• For this reason, the physiotherapist should not start the assessment until accurate
communication occurs and informed consent is provided.
D. Wait to perform the assessment and refer the patient to another staff member who speaks
Punjabi.
• It is the physiotherapist's job to determine an effective means to communicate instead
of referring the patient to someone else.
Vignette: A physiotherapist is working in a long-term care facility. They enter the room
to see if one of their regular clients wants to participate in their exercises today. The
patient has been diagnosed with dementia. At times, the patient can find it very
challenging to find the correct words. They also take longer to articulate a sentence
and, for that reason, can become upset and stop talking during sessions. During
today's session, they appear slightly confused and do not respond when the
physiotherapist asks if they want to participate in the exercise.
Question: Given the information presented in this vignette, which of the following
would be an ineffective way to communicate with the patient?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Speak slowly and use clear single-step instructions.
Tell the patient what they will be doing during the session.
Use yes or no questions so the patient has an easier time responding.
D Use gestures, demonstrations, and visual cues instead of a lot of talking.
This answer is incorrect. The correct answer is 'B'.
A. Speak slowly and use clear single-step instructions.
• This would be an effective way to communicate.
• Speaking slowly and using single-step instructions would be appropriate strategies to
minimize confusion.
B. Tell the patient what they will be doing during the session. - Best answer
• This would be an ineffective way to communicate.
• In this scenario, the patient does not respond when they are asked about exercise.
• Toto engage the patient in their exercises, it would be better to gain their interest in
participating by asking them what they would like to do first. This may encourage
participation vs telling them what they must do first.
C. Use yes or no questions so the patient has an easier time responding.
This would be an effective way to communicate.
D. Use gestures, demonstrations, and visual cues instead of a lot of talking.
• This would be an effective way to communicate.
Vignette: A physiotherapist is working in a rehabilitation facility, and they are treating
a patient who suffered a stroke 2 months ago. The stroke resulted in right hemiplegia
and Wernicke's aphasia.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed to ensure effective
communication?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Decrease background noises.
Speak as they normally would but speak slowly and allow more time for the
patient to respond.
Use gestures and demonstrations when communicating.
D None of the above
A. Decrease background noises.
• This is not wrong, but it is not the best answer given the options provided.
B. Speak as they normally would but speak slowly and allow more time for the patient to
respond.
It is always important to allow a patient with aphasia more time to respond but
speaking normally to the patient would not be correct given the patient's difficulty
understanding what the physiotherapist is saying verbally.
C. Use gestures and demonstrations when communicating. - Best answer
• With Wernicke's (receptive) aphasia, the patient cannot understand what the
physiotherapist is saying verbally.
• For this reason, using gestures and demonstrations will help the physiotherapist
communicate.
D. None of the above

W h a t is a c o n fl i c t o f i n t e r e s t ?
Definition: A conflict of interest is a breach of an obligation to one's professional ethics which has the
effect, or intention, of advancing one's own interest or the interest of others in a way detrimental to
the interest of the client, or potentially harmful to the integrity of the physical therapy profession.
Conflicts of interest and the appearance of conflicts of interest must be avoided.
Keys to avoiding perceived or real conflicts of interest:
• Al decisions should be made in the patient's best interest and with the patient's full
knowledge.
• Al decisions should be made on behalf of the patient, regardless of who is paying for
t r e a t m e n t .
• Al decisions should be made without the incentive of financial gain.
• Products and services that are not clinically indicated should not be recommend.
• Your professional decisions should not result in a benefit to you, or someone you know. For
example:
• A coupon for free yoga for each person you refer to their studio.
• Getting a kickback (sum of money) for every massage gun a patient purchases at your
clinic.
• Giving a gift card to a local doctor for each referral they send to you.
It is important to note that a physiotherapist cannot benefit or give benefits for a patient referral.
Referrals should be based on what the patient needs. The proper way to offer a referral is to provide
a range of options.
How to avoid real or perceived conflicts of interest?
Every effort should be made to avoid a conflict of interest. If it is not possible, you must disclose the
conflict with your patient before providing services by doing the following:
• Explain how you will gain from the situation (e.g., the patient is buying physiotherapy tape at
the clinic you own and the clinic makes money on the purchase of the tape).
• Discuss alternate services or products that the patient can choose from (list options locally
that sell the same or similar tape).
• Assure the patient that if they choose to purchase the product elsewhere, it will not adversely
affect their physiotherapy care.
• Chart the discussion in the patient's chart.
Examples of conflicts of interest
• Giving or receiving rebates, or gifts of extraordinary benefit.
• Continuing services to a client when the services are no longer required by the client.
• Recommending products or services that benefit you financially.
• Providing a fee to another health care professional for referring patients to you.
• Referring patient to colleagues/friends.
• Treating a family member or friend when there are other suitable options.
• Having an additional relationship beyond the physical therapist/patient relationship where
clinical judgment could be, or could be reasonably perceived to be, affected. For example:
• Using the client as a confidant or for personal support.
• Inviting the client to social engagements, or dating.
• Using one's position of power to obtain an opportunity to be involved with clients for
financial gain.
Incentives
There are no specific rules about the use of incentives in clinical practice. Examples of incentives
could include:
• Therapists receive gift cards if they book a certain number of new assessments per week.
• Therapists receive free or upgraded parking if they have a full caseload for the week.
• The clinic covers the cost of parking for patients while they attend their physiotherapy
sessions.
• Patients receive a gift card when signing up for an initial assessment.
Receiving incentives is a gray area due to the potential of a conflict of interest. For this reason, the
use of incentives requires significant reflection. When offering incentives, clinicians must ensure the
following:
• Professional judgment (e.g., clinical decision and ongoing treatment) cannot be compromised
by an incentive.
• PT services should always be clinically indicated and not based upon the incentive.
• Invoices should reflect the exact cost of services and the cost of the incentive cannot be added
to the invoice (e.g., if using a third-party payor).
Vignette: A physiotherapist has been working with 45-year-old patient who suffered a
distal radial ulnar joint fracture 5 months ago after falling off a ladder. The patient has
been compliant with their home exercises and has made an excellent recovery. They
report that they are pain free and has regained full forearm and wrist range of motion
and strength. He has returned to work and all of his sporting activities.
Question: At the time of discharge, the patient is very thankful for the services that
have been offered by the physiotherapist. They request that physiotherapy services
continue because they have had a lot of fun and do not want to lose any of the gains
they have made. How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Allow the patient to continue physiotherapy services but with the physiotherapy
assistant (PTA).
B Educate the patient about the costs associated with ongoing physiotherapy
services vs an independent community gym program.
Educate the patient that physiotherapy services are no longer required.
D Continue with regular physiotherapy sessions to respect the patient's goals of
maintaining their current function.
A. Allow the patient to continue physiotherapy services but with the physiotherapy assistant
(PTA).
• Physiotherapists should not continue services, even with a PTA, when they are no
longer required by the patient.
• This patient has fully recovered from his fracture and would benefit from a home
program provided at discharge to maintain his ROM and strength.
B. Educate the patient about the costs associated with ongoing physiotherapy services vs an
independent community gym program.
• While there are significant cost differences between regular physiotherapy sessions
and attending a local gym, this does not highlight the conflict of interest associated
with treating a patient who no longer requires physiotherapy services.
• Regardless of the patient's finances, treatment should only be offered and continued
when the patient requires it.
C. Educate the patient that physiotherapy services are no longer required. - Best answer
• This is the best answer as it focuses on educating the patient and avoids a conflict of
interest.
D. Continue with regular physiotherapy sessions to respect the patient's goals of maintaining
their current function.
• This is a conflict of interest and should be avoided.
• The patient no longer requires physiotherapy services and can maintain his function
through a home program without regular physiotherapy visits.
Vignette: A physiotherapist is treating a 65-year-old patient who suffered a stroke
resulting in left hemiplegia. The patient has increased tone in both their upper and
lower extremities. The patient has become concerned with the muscle tightness and
pain they are experiencing in their left arm and hand.
Question: The physiotherapist would like to recommend a resting splint to assist in
positioning of the left hand to prevent any flexion contractures from forming. The
clinic has off the shelf splints that are available for purchase that are significantly
eaper than custom splints. How should the physiotherapist proceed with
recommending a splint?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Offer the patient the off the shelf splint that can be purchased through the clinic
because it is more affordable and the patient can begin to use the splint
immediately.
B Provide the patient with several splint options including the splint available to
purchase through the clinic.
Avoid promoting any products directly sold by the clinic and provide the patient
with a list of splints that can be purchased online.
D Ask the patient about their budget before suggesting any type of splinting/bracing
for their hand.
A. Offer the patient the off the shelf splint that can be purchased through the clinic because it
is more affordable and the patient can begin to use the splint immediately.
• The physiotherapist needs to make sure that they are providing alternative options
given that the clinic stands to make a profit from selling the split that they have in
stock.
B. Provide the patient with several splint options including the splint available to purchase
through the clinic. - Best answer
• This is the best option as it avoids any conflict of interest.
• Physiotherapists can suggest and sell products that are carried by their clinic as long as
they provide alternative options to the patient and ensure that they advise the patient
that choosing a product sold elsewhere will not adversely affect their care.
C. Avoid promoting any products directly sold by the clinic and provide the patient with a list
of splints that can be purchased online.
• Physiotherapists can suggest and sell products that are carried by their clinic as long as
they provide alternative options to the patient.
D. Ask the patient about their budget before suggesting any type of splinting/bracing for
their hand.
• While it is not wrong to determine a patient's budget before offering splinting options,
this is not the best answer.
• The biggest consideration is for the physiotherapist to ensure they are giving their
patient alternative options.
• Simply asking their budget does not mean that there is a guarantee that the patient
will be given a choice in bracing options.
Vignette: A new physiotherapy clinic focusing on neurological rehabilitation has
ecently opened and the owner is looking for ways to attract new patients. She decides
to head to the outpatient rehabilitation facility at one of the local hospitals to speak to
the therapists on staff.
Question: How should the owner proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Offer the therapist a $10 referral bonus for all clients sent to the clinic through the
outpatient rehabilitation department.
B Offer free hospital in-services for every 10 clients sent to the clinic through the
outpatient rehabilitation department.
C Avoid all advertisements at the local hospital as it is a conflict of interest.
D Try to speak to as many therapists and hand out as many business
cards/brochures as possible to ensure awareness of the new clinic.
A. Offer the therapist a $10 referral bonus for all clients sent to the clinic through the
outpatient rehabilitation department.
• This is a conflict of interest.
• Physiotherapists must not give any benefit to another person or receive any benefit
from another person for a patient referral.
B. Offer free hospital in-services for every 10 clients sent to the clinic through the outpatient
rehabilitation department.
• This is a conflict of interest.
• Physiotherapists must not give any benefit to another person or receive any benefit
from another person for a patient referral.
C. Avoid all advertisements at the local hospital as it is a conflict of interest.
• The owner is allowed to advertise for her clinic as long as she is not offering incentives.
D. Try to speak to as many therapists and hand out as many business cards/brochures as
possible to ensure awareness of the new clinic. - Best answer
• This is a great example of the hard work that goes into starting a business.
• Brochures and business cards are an option as well as the use of social media to
advertise a newly opened clinic.
Vignette: A physiotherapist is working with a patient who suffers from patellofemoral
pain syndrome. The patient would benefit from orthotics to help decrease foot
pronation a n d improve their lower limb biomechanics. The physiotherapist's friend is
an excellent orthotist who works locally in the same city.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Refer their patient to their friend because they are an excellent orthotist.
Provide the patient with a list of local orthotists including their friend and advise
the patient that their friend is an excellent orthotist.
Provide the patient with a list of orthotists.
D Avoid referring to their friend as this is a conflict of interest.
This answer is incorrect. The correct answer is 'C' .
A. Refer their patient to their friend because they are an excellent orthotist.
• The physiotherapist is not giving the patient choice and there is a conflict of interest -
the choice of orthotic provider is based on the physiotherapist's friend gaining a
patient for financial gain.
B. Provide the patient with a list of local orthotists including their friend and advise the
patient that their friend is an excellent orthotist.
• The physiotherapist should provide the patient with a variety of options on where they
can have orthotics fabricated (including their friend's business) without biasing their
friend's business.
C. Provide the patient with a list of orthotists. - Best answer
• This is the best option as it demonstrates the importance of giving the patient choice in
their decision-making without biasing any single orthotist.
D. Avoid referring to their friend as this is a conflict of interest.
• The physiotherapist can refer to their friend, but they need to provide a variety of other
options and cannot bias their friend's business.
Vignette: A physiotherapist just started working at a busy private practice clinic. Their
caseload is slowly growing. They have received a few referrals from current patients
and realize the positive impact this is having on their caseload.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed with growing their caseload?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Thank the patients for their referrals and continue providing excellent
physiotherapy services.
B Provide $5 gift certificates for the local coffee shop to patients who refer others to
the clinic.
Ask the patient to leave a positive review on social media.
D A and C
This answer is incorrect. The correct answer is 'A'.
A. Thank the patients for their referrals and continue providing excellent physiotherapy
services. - Best answer
B. Provide $5 gift certificates for the local coffee shop to patients who refer others to the
clinic.
• This is a conflict of interest.
• This is considered as giving a benefit to someone for financial gain.
• Physiotherapists should avoid conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of
interest, between their personal interests and the best interests of their patients.
C. Ask the patient to leave a positive review on social media.
• Asking the patient to leave a positive review is a conflict of interest.
• Ratings are allowed but must be given by the free will of the patient and no benefits or
rewards can be given for a review.

Informed consent
Physiotherapists are required to obtain consent for conducting an assessment, treatment,
involvement of another person in the patient's care (e.g., a PTA or PT student), or releasing the
patient's personal information to third parties.
Informed consent
• Before initiating any assessment or treatment, physiotherapists must get informed consent. To
provide informed consent, the patient must have:
• The ability to make the decision of their own free will (agree voluntarily).
• The capacity to give consent (i.e., they understand what the physiotherapist is stating
regarding treatment as well as the risks involved in their consent or refusal of that
treatment).
• Truthful and accurate information regarding their healthcare.
• A reasonable amount of information provided by the physiotherapist to make a
decision. Al of the following should be discussed in order to properly obtain informed
c o n s e n t .
• Information regarding the condition being treated.
• The proposed health care (information on the treatment being proposed, the
duration and frequency of treatment etc.).
• The risks and benefits of the proposed treatment.
• Any alternative options that are available for treatment.
- Provides the patient with the opportunity to ask questions and receive answers
about the proposed treatment plan.
• The physiotherapist must document that informed consent was received.
• The physiotherapist can receive consent in several ways:
• Verbal (the patient states they are consenting to proceed with the treatment plan).
• Written (the patient signs a form agreeing to the proposed treatment).
• Written (the patient signs a form agreeing to the proposed treatment).
• A signed intake form or a check of a box on a consent form does not imply
informed consent as the physiotherapist may not have discussed all aspects of
informed consent (see list above).
• Implied consent: consent can be implied based on behaviour or actions.
• For example, a patient sitting on your treatment table and exposing the area to be
treated.
It is important to note that consent is a process of ongoing dialogue and needs to be obtained
throughout your sessions and within each treatment session. The patient can withdraw their
consent at any time.
Every adult who is able to give or refuse consent for physiotherapy has the right to:
• Provide or refuse consent (for example, due to moral or religious reasons), even if the
refusal will result in death.
• Provide or refuse consent for a certain part of a treatment (for example, I consent to
exercise but not to the use of ultrasound therapy).
• Revoke consent at any time.
• Have their decision respected by the physiotherapist
• Be involved in the decision-making regarding their own care.
The physiotherapist must communicate with the patient in a way that ensures they
understand the information being provided to them. The physiotherapist should use layman's
terms and, if needed, take extra steps to ensure the patient understands what is being
discussed. For example:
• A patient who does not speak the same language as the physiotherapist.
• A translator should be used to ensure clear communication between both parties.
• A patient with receptive aphasia.
• The physiotherapist should use gestures, pictures, and body language to
communicate.
Capacity to give consent
The patient's capacity to give consent can change over time based on a patient's condition.
• For example, if a patient has mild dementia, they may be able to consent to treatment at
certain times of the day when lucid but unable to at other times when confused. It is up to the
physiotherapist to determine if the patient has the capacity to consent to treatment.
• You will need to use your clinical reasoning from the information in the scenario to determine
if the patient is capable of giving consent. Keep an eye out for scenarios that include the
following:
• Psychiatric conditions: delusional thinking, the appearance of severe depression.
• Age: either very young or very old (do not make an assumption based on age!).
• The appearance of not being able to make a confident choice about giving consent.
• Severe pain that inhibits them from concentrating on the decision.
• The appearance of intoxication from illicit or prescribed drugs or alcohol.
The physiotherapist should initially assume that a patient has the capacity to give informed consent.
• A patient is deemed incapable of making decisions about their personal care if:
• They cannot understand information related to making decisions about their health care
and wellbeing.
• For example, severe dementia prevents a patient from knowing where they are or
the people around them.
• They do not understand the consequences of their decisions regarding health care.
• For example, they do not understand that refusing physiotherapy can result in
pneumonia and possible death.
If you determine that the patient does not have the capacity to provide consent for a proposed
treatment, you must inform the patient. The patient should be involved in the consent process to the
extent that is reasonably possible given their situation.
If you determine that the patient does not have the capacity to provide consent for a proposed
treatment, you must inform the patient. The patient should be involved in the consent process to the
extent that is reasonably possible given their situation.
• If a patient is not capable of providing consent, the physiotherapist must find a substitute
decision-maker to provide consent on behalf of the patient.
Substitute decision-maker
Definition: A substitute decision-maker is a person who has been appointed to make decisions on
the behalf of an individual if they are unable to make those decisions themselves. The substitute
decision-maker must be at least 16 years of age (or older) and available, willing, and capable to act
on the behalf of the individual.
The amount of decision making given to the substitute decision-maker can vary. For example, they
may be given authority for full decision-making or they may only be given authority to make certain
decisions. The substitute decision-maker's authority can be revoked if the patient's capacity returns.
• There is a hierarchy for who will represent the patient as their substitute decision-maker which
varies slightly province to province. You do not need to memorize the order. Just know that a
substitute decision-maker can make decisions based on the patient's behalf if the patient
cannot do so for themselves (e.g., they are in a coma or cognitively impaired).
You can rely on the substitute decision-maker stating they have been appointed, they are not
required to show formal documentation. In other words, the physiotherapist can trust the word of
the substitute decision-maker alone.
Exception to consent - urgent or emergency health care
A physiotherapist may provide health care to a patient without their consent if the care is urgent and
necessary to preserve the patient's life, to prevent serious physical or mental harm, or to alleviate
severe pain.
In these urgent or emergency situations, all of the following must apply:
• The patient is incapable of giving or refusing consent.
• For example, the patient is:
• Unconscious or semi-conscious
• Suffering from delirium or severe dementia
• Under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol
• The patient does not have a personal guardian or substitute decision-maker to consent to the
health care or the substitute decision-maker is unavailable.
• The treatment provided is within your scope of practice and beneficial to the patient.
Involving others in care
When involving others in patient care (physiotherapy assistants, PT students, or volunteers), the
physiotherapist is responsible for obtaining consent from the patient (or substitute decision-maker).
See Supervision and Working with a Physiotherapy Assistant (PTA)
If you are a physiotherapist covering for a physiotherapy colleague:
• You can rely on the consent for treatment obtained by your physiotherapy colleague unless the
patient's status/condition has changed. Meaning, you are not required to gain consent for a
treatment that has already been consented to unless the patient's status/condition has
changed.
• You are required to get the patient's consent to work with you that day. So you still need to get
the patient's consent to work with you specifically.
• You are required to get consent for any changes to the original treatment plan.
Mature m i n o r
Can a minor give consent?
Children may consent to or refuse medical treatment on their own as long as the health care
provider is sure that the treatment is in the child's best interest and the child understands the
following:
• Details of the t r e a t m e n t
• Risks and b e n e fi t s of t r e a t m e n t
It is up to the health care provider to assess and ensure the child's understanding of the treatment. A
child who is a mature minor may make their own health decisions independent of their guardian's
wishes. There is no set age at which a child is considered capable of giving consent.

へ
In any situation where you are working with a patient who is not of sound mind, it is important
to try to explain the treatment and gain the patient's consent. Your goal is to involve them in
their care and decision making as much as possible. By doing this, you are more likely to have
patient compliance during treatment.
Adult without sound
mind and SDM is
unknown or unavailable
• The physiotherapist is accountable for determining the patient's
capacity to provide informed consent. This can fluctuate even
within the hours of the day (e.g., for example, a patient in ICU
may be too sedated in the morning to consent to treatment but
are alert and able to consent in the afternoon).
• Physiotherapists should constantly re-assess their patient's
capacity to provide consent, and if unable, seek out their SDM.
• An exception to this is in an emergency. In a situation where
consent cannot be explicitly granted (e.g., adult without sound
mind and no SDM is present), a physiotherapist may provide
health care without consent if the care is urgent and necessary to
preserve the patient's life, to prevent serious physical or mental
harm, or to alleviate severe pain.
• In these situations, any care provided by the
physiotherapist must be within their scope of practice and
beneficial to the patient.
• In other words, unless the situation is an emergency, the
physiotherapist must wait to gain consent from the SDM.
• Examples of emergency situations (preserving life or
preventing serious harm or pain):
• Patient has a seizure and needs to be positioned on
their side to prevent choking.
- Patient with swallowing issues begins to choke and
cannot breathe.
• Patient demonstrates signs of heat stroke and
becomes delirious.
• Patient loses consciousness during a treatment

QUESTION 1 OF 9
Vignette: Your patient is coming to see you at a private clinic for treatment of whiplash
following a car accident 3 months ago. They attend the appointment with their spouse.
While taking the patient's history, the spouse often interjects and gives additional
information pertaining to the injury. The patient seems frustrated, but is able to
provide a thorough history.
Question: Before beginning treatment, you obtain the patient's informed consent.
Vhich of the following is not mandatory in order to receive informed consent?
Choose only ONE best answer.

D
The physiotherapist must ask the they have informed consent.
patient's spouse to leave the room to ensure
This a n s w e r is correct.
A. The physiotherapist must explain risks and benefits of each proposed treatment that a
reasonable person would expect to be told.
• This is mandatory
B. Consent is given voluntarily.
• This is mandatory
C. The adult is capable of making a decision about whether to give or refuse treatment.
• This is mandatory
D. The physiotherapist must ask the patient's spouse to leave the room to ensure they have
informed consent. - Best answer
• This is not mandatory - the vignette does not lead you to believe that consent is being
obtained by coercion or misrepresentation. The therapist would not need to ask the
spouse to leave. If the spouse was pressuring the patient to obtain treatment, you
would need to ask to speak to the patient in private to ensure their consent was given
without influence.
Vignette: A physiotherapist is treating an adult who recently obtained a traumatic
brain injury. He is a 12 on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). The doctor has stated that he
needs repositioning every 3 hours to help heal his pressure wounds. The patient is
fatigued but responsive to your commands.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Based on the patient's injury, the physiotherapist should assume they do not have
the capacity to consent and find a substitute decision-maker.
Assess the patient's capacity to determine if they can provide informed consent to
treatment.
Modify treatment to include passive range of motion exercises as the patient has
had this treatment before and was comfortable with it.
D Assume consent has been refused as he is an adult of sound mind.
A. Based on the patient's injury, the physiotherapist should assume they do not have the
capacity to consent and find a substitute decision-maker.
• While a GCS of 12 indicates a moderate brain injury, the physiotherapist should not
assume the patient does not have the capacity to provide consent.
B. Assess the patient's capacity to determine if they can provide informed consent to
treatment. - Best answer
• The physiotherapist should initially assume that a patient has the capacity to give
informed consent by asking questions and determining their competency.
• If the physiotherapist determines that the patient does not have the capacity to
consent to treatment, they should inform the patient of this and then find a substitute
decision-maker.
• This is a great resource to understand the in-depth process of determining a substitute
decision-maker. This depth of knowledge is not needed for the exam, but it will allow
you to see the that it can take time to determine who the substitute decision-maker is.
C. Modify treatment to include passive range of motion exercises as the patient has had this
treatment before and was comfortable with it.
• This is not the best answer as this may not be the optimal or necessary treatment for
this patient and the physiotherapist still needs to assess competency to see if they can
gain consent for treatment.
D. Assume consent has been refused as he is an adult of sound mind.
• The vignette gives us some information about the patient (12 on the GCS, history of
TBI, fatigued but responsive to commands), but not enough to decide that he is
definitely of sound mind. It also does not state anything about consent being refused.
Vignette: A physiotherapist enters a treatment room to assess a new patient who is 14-
years-old. They have been diagnosed with Osgood schlatter's disease and referred to
physiotherapy by their family physician. The patient is alone and states his parents
dropped him off and went to the store. After a few minutes of interaction, the
physiotherapist decides the patient is not a mature minor.
Question: What is the best course of action?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Inform the patient that they cannot provide treatment and ask the patient to wait
in the waiting room for their parents to pick them up.
Ask the patient if they are able to reach their parent to see if they can join for the
remainder of the treatment session.
Perform the assessment only and wait for the parents consent before providing
treatment.
D Do not treat the patient and document the interaction and request that the
parents attend all future sessions.
This answer is incorrect. The correct answer is 'B'
A. Inform the patient that they cannot provide treatment and ask the patient to wait in the
waiting room for their parents to pick them up.
• While it is correct that the physiotherapist should not proceed with the physiotherapy
session, simply ending the session is not the most effective use of the patient's time as
the parents may be able to make it back to provide consent for treatment.
B. Ask the patient if they are able to contact their parent to see if they can join for the
remainder of the treatment session. - Best answer
• It is important to try to reach the parents to see if you can gain consent as the patient is
a minor who has not been deemed a mature minor. This option provides the most
client centered approach.
C. Perform the assessment only and wait for the parents consent before providing
treatment.
• Without consent, no portion of the assessment or treatment can be completed.
D. Do not treat the patient and document the interaction and request that the parents attend
all future sessions.
• While this answer is not wrong, a reasonable effort should be made to contact the
patient's parents in order to gain consent.
QUESTION 4 OF 9
Vignette: You are a physiotherapist who works in a private rehabilitation clinic that
focused on individuals with neurological conditions. You are about to see a new
patient for an initial assessment. Upon arrival, the receptionist provides the patient
with their consent forms for physiotherapy.
Question: Which of the following is correct regarding the use of consent forms?
Choose only ONE best answer.
The patient can fill out the consent form while in the waiting room waiting for the
initial assessment to take place.
Consent can only be granted if a consent form is signed.
Consent forms can be confusing and should be avoided if possible.
D A signed consent form does not imply informed consent.
A. The patient can fill out the consent form while in the waiting room waiting for the initial
assessment to take place.
• This is incorrect as informed consent has not been gained.
• The patient has not been informed of the nature of the treatment, the risks, benefits,
alternative options, or consequences of not having treatment. Also, they have not been
given a chance to ask questions and have those questions answered.
• For this reason, they should not fill out the consent form while waiting for their initial
assessment.
• This form should be signed after the physiotherapist has a chance to inform the patient
about the proposed treatment.
B. Consent can only be granted if a consent form is signed.
• This statement is incorrect.
• The physiotherapist can receive consent in several ways:
• Verbal - the patient states they are consenting to proceed with the treatment
plan.
• Written - the patient signs a form agreeing to the proposed treatment.
• Implied - consent can be implied based on behaviour or actions.
C. Consent forms can be confusing and should be avoided if possible.
• This statement is incorrect.
• Consent forms, if used correctly, can provide the therapist with documentation
regarding their patients consent and are used frequently in health care.
D. A signed consent form does not imply informed consent. - Best answer
• This statement is correct.
• A signed consent form does not imply informed consent as the physiotherapist may
not have discussed all aspects of informed consent with the patient before they signed
the form.
Vignette: A physiotherapist is working in a private practice clinic and is about to
perform an initial assessment on a 15-year-old who sprained their wrist while playing
volleyball. Their parents are not present for the assessment.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Determine if the patient is a mature minor.
Given that the patient is a minor, call and ask the parents to return to gain consent
for the assessment and treatment.
Perform the assessment and then wait to gain consent from the parents for
treatment.
D Assume the patient is a mature minor given their age and the nature of their
injury.
A. Determine if the patient is a mature minor. - Best answer
• If the physiotherapist decides that the patient is a mature minor, they can get the
patient's informed consent to assess and treat.
• The physiotherapist must use their judgement to decide if the child is a mature minor
and can provide informed consent. Things to consider:
• Is the child paying attention?
• Are they asking appropriate questions?
• Do they understand what you are telling them?
• The physiotherapist should document the interaction and that they have deemed the
patient a mature minor.
• If the physiotherapist does not deem them a mature minor, then they should not
proceed with the assessment. They should call the parents and ask if they can come to
the appointment to be present for the assessment to provide consent for assessment
and treatment.
B. Given that the patient is a minor, call and ask the parents to return to gain consent for the
assessment and treatment.
• If the physiotherapist decides that the patient is a mature minor, they can get the
patient's informed consent to assess and treat and do not need to gain consent from
their parents.
C. Perform the assessment and then wait to gain consent from the parents for treatment.
• The first issue at hand is to determine if the patient is a mature minor or not because
this dictates if they can provide informed consent or not.
• Without consent, no portion of the assessment or treatment can be completed.
D. Assume the patient is a mature minor given their age and the nature of their injury.
• The physiotherapist should never just assume the patient is a mature minor.
Vignette: A new graduate physiotherapist is working in a private practice setting. They
understand that gaining consent is critical.
Question: After an initial assessment, which of the following should be included in the
patient's chart when documenting that consent was obtained?
Choose only ONE best answer.
The proposed treatment.
Alternative treatment options.
Any questions asked by the patient and answers provided by the physiotherapist.
D All of the above
This a n s w e r i s correct.
A. The proposed treatment.
B. Alternative treatment options.
C. Any questions asked by the patient and answers provided by the physiotherapist.
D. All of the above - Best answer
• The following should be documented:
• The information discussed:
• Information regarding the condition being treated
• Proposed treatment
• Benefits and possible risks of treatment
• Consequences of not receiving treatment
• Alternative treatment options
• Who w a s involved in the discussion
• Any questions asked by the patient and answers provided by the
physiotherapist.
• If the patient has signed a written consent form, include this in their chart.
Vignette: A physiotherapist works in the intensive care unit (ICU) and enters the room
to perform chest physiotherapy on a patient with significant secretions. The patient
has been having issues with oxygen saturation and their health status has been
declining over the last few days. The patient is awake and oriented when the
physiotherapist arrives and refuses treatment. The physiotherapist is concerned the
patient is going to decline further without treatment.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Insist on treatment and educate the patient on the importance of secretion
removal.
B Respect the patient's wishes as they are of sound mind.
Provide the patient with alternative treatment options.
D Discharge the patient from physiotherapy.
A. Insist on treatment and educate the patient on the importance of secretion removal.
• The physiotherapist needs to respect the patient's wishes, they are of sound mind.
• Insisting on treatment is not showing respect for the patient's wishes.
B. Respect the patient's wishes as they are of sound mind.
• While this statement is true, it is not the best answer as option C highlights the
importance of providing alternative treatment options.
C. Provide the patient with alternative treatment options. - Best answer
• When a patient of sound mind refuses treatment, the physiotherapist should educate
the patient on the importance of secretion removal, the risks of not receiving the
treatment and provide alternative options.
• Providing alternative options gives the patient choice in their health care. If they
choose an alternative option, the physiotherapist can then provide care that is
beneficial to the patient versus providing no care at all.
• The physiotherapist should document the interaction in the patient's records and bring
this to the attention of the team during the next team meeting/rounds.
D. Discharge the patient from physiotherapy.
• This is not the best answer.
• If the patient refuses treatment and/or any alternative options presented, the
physiotherapist cannot treat. At this point they could stop providing care unless the
patient changes their mind. This would, however, not be the first choice given the
options presented.
• It would be important for the physiotherapist to document the interaction in the
patient's records and bring this to the attention of the team during the next team
meeting/rounds.
Vignette: A physiotherapist is about to start a session with their patient, but the
patient seems to be acting abnormally. They are slurring their words. When asked, the
patient states they have smoked marijuana and are high. The patient states that they
have a medical license to smoke marijuana due to chronic back pain.
Question: Given that the patient is using the marijuana legally for pain management,
how should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
A Treat the patient but avoid any high-risk treatments such as manual therapy or
modalities.
Ask the patient to leave and attend the next session sober.
Given that the patient has a medical license, treat as per usual.
D Educate the patient on why they cannot treat them.
This answer is incorrect. The correct answer is 'D' .
A. Treat the patient but avoid any high-risk treatments such as manual therapy or
modalities.
• If the patient is impaired, either from non-prescription or prescription medication, the
physiotherapist cannot reliably gain consent and should not treat.
B. Ask the patient to leave and attend the next session sober.
• While this is not wrong, it is not the best answer. Simply asking the patient to leave
could appear rude. The physiotherapist should educate the patient on why they cannot
treat them to avoid any conflict and misunderstanding with the patient.
C. Given that the patient has a medical license, treat as per usual.
• If the patient is impaired, either from non-prescription or prescription medication, the
physiotherapist cannot reliably gain consent.
D. Educate the patient on why they cannot treat them. - Best answer
• If the physiotherapist believes the patient is under the influence and their judgement
may be compromised, they should not treat.
• Every time a patient arrives for an appointment, the physiotherapist needs to decide if
they can provide consent. If the patient is impaired, either from non-prescription or
prescription medication, the physiotherapist cannot reliably gain consent.
• The physiotherapist should educate the patient on why they cannot treat them.
• They are not capable of providing consent and the treatment would be risky to
them in their condition - they cannot provide proper feedback during treatment,
and this could result in injury.
• The patient should be advised to attend the next session sober.
Vignette: A physiotherapist is working in the emergency department and the
emergency room physician has given orders to mobilize a new patient who arrived 2
hours ago. When the physiotherapist enters the room, the patient is intoxicated,
disoriented, and slurring their speech.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Assess and treat based on the physician's orders.
Return later in their shift to see if the patient can provide consent once sober.
C Wait until the patient's substitute decision-maker provides consent for treatment.
D Try to assess the patient and if they do not follow commands, stop and wait until
they are sober.
A. Assess and treat based on the physician's orders.
• Regardless of the physician's orders, the physiotherapist is accountable for
determining the patient's capacity to provide informed consent.
• The vignette provides information that should lead you to make the decision that the
patient is not capable of providing informed consent (e.g., disoriented and
intoxicated).
B. Return later in their shift to see if the patient can provide consent once sober. - Best
a n s w e r
• It is important to note, that although this patient cannot provide consent at this time,
they may be able to provide informed consent later once they are sober.
• The ability to provide consent can evolve or change throughout the day as seen in this
scenario.
• For example, a patient in ICU may be too sedated in the morning to consent to
treatment but are alert and able to consent in the afternoon.
C. Wait until the patient's substitute decision-maker provides consent for treatment.
• While the patient is under the influence, it is correct to gain consent from a substitute
decision-maker. However, waiting to treat until the physiotherapist gains consent from
the substitute decision-maker is not the best choice in this scenario as the patient may
sober up and be able to provide consent for themselves before the physiotherapist
finds the substitute decision-maker.
D. Try to assess the patient and if they do not follow commands, stop and wait until they are
sober.
• The vignette provides information that should lead you to make the decision that the
patient is not capable of providing informed consent (e.g., disoriented and
intoxicated).

• Because of this, the assessment should not take place at this time.
Important elements of draping
Draping is sometimes necessary to allow physiotherapists to access a body area during their clinical
assessment and treatment. Exposing treatment areas can be uncomfortable for patients. In order to
create a safe, and comfortable treatment environment, physiotherapists must do the following when
draping:
• Provide adequate, clean draping materials for patients.
• Examples include: examination gowns, shorts or sheets
• Explain the purpose of exposing the area, the body parts that need to be exposed, and provide
them with options for draping.
• Gain consent from the patient regarding undressing and/or draping.
• Clearly communicate the plan including how they will be therapeutically touching their
patient.
• Maintain the dignity of the patient at all times by minimizing the amount and time the body
part is exposed.
• Drape the patient appropriately, according to the pathology and the individual patient's
n e e d s .
• If possible, allow the patient to hold onto the sheet to keep it from moving. This also gives the
patient some control and comfort with respect to draping.
• Check in with the patient regularly to ensure they are comfortable.
Vignette: A physiotherapist is working with a 77-year-old female who fractured her
right hip requiring a total hip replacement (THR) 3 days ago. She has severe dementia
and her daughter, the substitute decision-maker, previously consented to
physiotherapy. Since surgery, the patient has been unable to follow any cues or initiate
any rehabilitation exercises on her own.
Question: The physiotherapist enters the room to perform passive range of motion
(PROM) within safe ranges for the right hip. They approach the patient and note that
the patient has removed her robe and is not wearing any clothing. How should the
physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
The physiotherapist should avoid looking directly at the patient but carry on with
PROM as daily PROM is critical to ensure proper rehabilitation.
The physiotherapist should look for the patient's robe, a sheet or other material to
use for draping before proceeding with PROM.
The physiotherapist should immediately leave the room and get nursing to assist
with dressing the patient prior to their physiotherapy session.
D The physiotherapist should educate the patient on the importance of wearing
their robe and ask for consent to dress the patient before performing PROM.
This answer is incorrect. The correct answer is 'B' .
A. The physiotherapist should avoid looking directly at the patient but carry on with PROM as
daily PROM is critical to ensure proper rehabilitation.
• This is not professional and does not ensure the dignity and respect of the client.
B. The physiotherapist should look for the patient's robe, a sheet or other material to use for
draping before proceeding with PROM. - Best answer
• Regardless of whether the patient has dementia or not, the physiotherapist must
always maintain the dignity of the patient.
C. The physiotherapist should immediately leave the room and get nursing to assist with
dressing the patient prior to their physiotherapy session.
• The physiotherapist does not necessarily need nursing staff to assist with draping.
They can drape the patient themselves and should only seek out nursing assistance if
they are unable to do so without assistance.
D. The physiotherapist should educate the patient on the importance of wearing their robe
and ask for consent to dress the patient before performing PROM.
• The vignette has clearly stated that the patient is not of sound mind and has a
substitute decision-maker who has given consent to treat.
• Educating them about the importance of wearing their robe will not be very beneficial
given their dementia.
• The issue at hand here is to ensure that this patient is covered up using draping to
ensure that their dignity is maintained while the physiotherapist is performing PROM.
Vignette: A physiotherapist needs to assess a patient's mid-back. This is best done
with the patient's shirt removed as the physiotherapist can ensure an accurate
observation.
Question: Which of the following is an important component of draping?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Educate the patient on why their shirt needs to be removed.
Provide options for draping.
Determine if the patient is comfortable disrobing.
D All of the above
This a n s w e r is correct.
A. Educate the patient on why their shirt needs to be removed.
• This is an important component of draping.
• The physiotherapist should educate the patient on why their shirt needed to be
removed before asking them to disrobe. This ensures that the patient understands why
this may be necessary.
B. Provide options for draping.
• This is an important component of draping.
• Patients should always be offered an option for draping when disrobing.
C. Determine if the patient is comfortable disrobing.
• This is an important component of draping.
• The physiotherapist should always ask the patient if they are comfortable removing
their shirt instead of just asking them to do so.
D. All of the above - Best answer
• Al of the options listed above are important components of draping.
This answer is correct.
A. Tell the patient that the assessment will be inaccurate and of no benefit.
• The physiotherapist can advise the patient that the treatment and/or assessment may
not be as effective, but they still need to respect the patient's decision and continue to
treat.
B. Say nothing and proceed to assess the patient's mid back with their shirt on.
• The physiotherapist should acknowledge the patient's decision to demonstrate that
they have been heard and their decision is respected.
C. Acknowledge the patient's decision and assess without disrobing. - Best answer
• This is the best answer to demonstrate that the patient's wishes are being
acknowledged and respected.
D. Ask them to expose their low back only.
• The patient has expressed that they do not want to disrobe. The physiotherapist
should respect this decision and avoid pressuring the patient into exposing their low
back.
Definition of electrophysical agents
Electrical, electromagnetic, thermal, light, or sound energies used in a therapeutic manner to reduce
impairments or promote recovery of function.
Electrophysical agents are sometimes referred to as "modalities", "thermal agents" or
"electrotherapy".
Device m a i n t e n a n c e
In accordance with federal and provincial requirements, all electrophysical agents must have a
medical device license issued by Health Canada in accordance with the requirements of Canadian
Medical Devices Regulations.
When using modalities, you are responsible for the following:
• Know the manufacturer's requirements for calibration. If the device does not have
recommendations, yearly calibration and electrical testing must be completed by an
electronics or biomedical technician. This must be documented.
• Keep a log of repairs made for each device. Repairs must be completed when indicated.
• Avoid the use of extension cords.
• Inspect the physical integrity of the device before each use. Observe the integrity of the
following if applicable:
• Leads
• Cords.
• Plugs
• A c c e s s o r i e s
• Conductivity of carbon rubber electrodes
Application of electrophysical agents
It is your responsibility to ensure that your patient is safe during the application of an
electrophysical agent.
• The patient must be aware of any precautions to the modality and be cleared of any
contraindications.
• A patient's informed consent must be obtained prior to the application of electro-physical
agents.
• Appropriate sensation testing must be performed:
• Thermal: hot/cold
• Electrical: sharp/dull
• Laser: none
• Appropriate application techniques specific to the selected electrophysical agent must be
used (e.g., the ultrasound head must be constantly moving).
• Patients must be instructed on how to obtain immediate assistance during treatment if the
therapist leaves the room.
• The patient's skin must be inspected after treatment.
• Effects of treatment must be monitored using outcome measures to ensure that techniques
are working and parameters are modified as needed.
• Any accessory that comes into contact with the patient must be cleaned according to current
infection control procedures.
The use of electrodes:
• Self-adhesive electrodes, or electrodes used on or around non-intact skin (e.g., peri-incisional,
wound healing) must be used only for a single patient.
• When electrodes are used, they must be secured in place.
Laser • w h e n electrodes are used, they must be secured in place.
t r e a t m e n t :
• When laser therapy is performed, goggles must be worn by the patient and the operator. Laser
devices must be used in a controlled area, with an appropriate warning sign.
D o c u m e n t a t i o n
Your chart note should include:
• A description of the device you used (i.e. TENS, Ultrasound)
• Dosage
• Body area treated
• If applicable: electrode placement
• Response to treatment
• Any changes to the treatment plan
Electrophysical agents and the PTA - general principles
Step 1:
It is up to the physiotherapist to determine if the patient is appropriate for the use of the
electrophysical agent. This can be done by clearing contraindications and determining if the
precautions are relevant to the condition and context.
Step 2:
The physiotherapist must ensure the PTA is competent in the application of the device for the
patient's condition and teach the PTA any modifications needed to meet the specific needs of the
patient.
Step 3:
The physiotherapist is responsible for teaching the PTA and patient the following:
• Why the modality has been chosen amongst other appropriate options.
• The mechanism of action, benefits, and risks of the modality.
• The expected response to the modality - during treatment and post treatment.
• How to contact the therapist if there is an unexpected/adverse reaction.
• Expectations of the patient during the treatment.
• For example: You will be contracting your quadricep muscle every time you feel the
NMES start to tingle.
Step 4:
Ensure the patient has the opportunity to ask questions and decline having the PTA applying the
electrophysical agent.
QUESTION 1 OF 4
Vignette: A physiotherapist is working with a 22-year-old patient who suffered a grade
3 rectus femoris contusion 1 day ago. The patient has previously worked with the
physiotherapist to rehabilitate their shoulder dislocation. The patient requests the use
of NMES for their leg as it helped in the past for their shoulder. The physiotherapist
advises the patient that the use of NMES is not indicated for an acute muscle
contusion, but the patient is adamant that they want to try NMES anyways.
Question: How should the physiotherapist manage this situation?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Educate the patient that the use of NMES is contraindicated over an acute muscle
contusion and provide alternative treatment options.
Educate the patient about the risks associated with using NMES over an acute
muscle contusion and allow the patient to decide how they would like to proceed.
Use NMES but only on a very low setting to avoid producing a muscle contraction.
D Tell the patient that NMES will not be used because it is contraindicated.
T h i s a n s w e r i s c o r r e c t .
A. Educate the patient that the use of NMES is contraindicated over an acute muscle
contusion and provide alternative treatment options. - Best answer
• The use of NMES is contraindicated over any actively bleeding tissue. Given the acute
nature and severity of this contusion, NMES should not be used.
• Prior to the application of any electrophysical agent, the physiotherapist must verify
that there are no contraindications to the proposed application of the specific
electrophysical agent and must be aware of any precautions to the application.
• Modalities should never be applied if a contraindication is present even if a patient is
requesting that modality.
• This is the best answer as it includes education, does not use the contraindicated
modality, and provides the patient with alternative treatment options.
B. Educate the patient about the risks associated with using NMES over an acute muscle
contusion and allow the patient to decide how they would like to proceed.
• The physiotherapist should never use a modality if a contraindication is present.
C. Use NMES but only on a very low setting to avoid producing a muscle contraction.
• The physiotherapist should never use a modality if a contraindication is present.
D. Tell the patient that NMES will not be used because it is contraindicated.
• This answer is not wrong, but is not the best answer.
Vignette: A physiotherapist used acupuncture-like TENS on a patient with chronic low
back pain. The physiotherapist had been unsuccessful with exercise, posture, and
hands on techniques for the patient's pain relief. Fortunately, the patient had excellent
pain relief using the TENS and felt that this was something they wanted to try again
with the hopes of purchasing a unit and using it at home. Unfortunately, the patient's
skin became red and irritated. The physiotherapist suspected that it was from the self-
adhesive on the electrodes.
Question: What is the best plan of action moving forwards to provide effective pain
relief for this patient?
Choose only ONE best answer.
A Once the skin is no longer irritated, try a conventional TENS setting.
Change the placement of the self-adhesive electrodes.
Once the skin is no longer irritated, try gel electrodes using the same
acupuncture-like TENS settings.
D Advise the patient against the use of TENS for pain relief.
A. Once the skin is no longer irritated, try a conventional TENS setting.
• When using modalities, the physiotherapist must evaluate the effects of treatment and
modify subsequent treatments as necessary to avoid adverse effects.
• In this situation, the patient's skin has become irritated so the physiotherapist must
modify future treatments to avoid this adverse effect.
• Conventional TENS is not the best option for treating chronic pain and is therefore not
the best option. Using conventional TENS also doesn't change the use of the self-
adhesive electrodes which may be the source of the issue.
B. Change the placement of the self-adhesive electrodes.
• Changing the placement of the self-adhesive electrodes is not going to prevent the
adverse effects that occurred in the first place.
C. Once the skin is no longer irritated, try gel electrodes using the same acupuncture-like
TENS settings. - Best answer
• This is the best answer because by using a different type of electrode, the
physiotherapist can monitor for any adverse effects and truly determine if the source of
the issue was the self-adhesive electrodes.
• If there are no adverse reactions after this treatment, then the patient can continue to
use this modality as an effective way to manage their chronic low back pain.
D. Advise the patient against the use of TENS for pain relief.
• This is not wrong, but not the best answer as the use of TENS was successful in
relieving the patient's chronic pain. If modifications can be made so that there are no
adverse effects, then TENS would be a great option for future use.
Vignette: A physiotherapist has been using ultrasound (US) regularly in their clinical
practice. During one of their sessions with a patient, the physiotherapist noticed that
the US wand started to vibrate in an abnormal manner.
Question: What is the most appropriate course of action?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Stop using the US machine and put it back on the shelf to cool down as it may
have overheated.
Lower the settings and continue to use the US machine if the vibration stops.
Ask the patient if they are feeling any changes in sensation and carry out the rest
of the treatment if the patient is feeling fine.
D Immediately stop using the US machine and notify the clinic manager.
This a n s w e r i s correct.
A. Stop using the US machine and put it back on the shelf to cool down as it may have
overheated.
• Physiotherapists must ensure that their equipment is calibrated and in good working
order.
• To ensure patient safety, the physiotherapist should stop using the device if they
suspect that anything abnormal is occurring.
• Simply putting the machine back on the shelf to cool off is not an appropriate action
because another staff member could use it.
B. Lower the settings and continue to use the US machine if the vibration stops.
• Adjusting the settings and carrying on with treatment is not a safe option.
• The US machine is not working as it should so the safest way for the physiotherapist to
proceed is to stop using the machine.
C. Ask the patient if they are feeling any changes in sensation and carry out the rest of the
treatment if the patient is feeling fine.
• This is not a safe option.
• The US machine is not working as it should so the safest way for the physiotherapist to
proceed is to stop using the machine.
D. Immediately stop using the US machine and notify the clinic manager. - Best answer
• This is the best answer as it addresses the need to avoid using any equipment that is
suspected to be working abnormally.
• The physiotherapist should remove the device so it cannot be used by any other staff
member and connect with management to have the device tuned/calibrated before
being used again clinically.
Vignette: You are working with a young woman who has a grade 2 right ATFL sprain.
You determine that the patient needs ultrasound to help manage their swelling. You
have been working with your PTA for 2 years and ask them to perform the ultrasound
treatment. You inform them of the appropriate parameters to use but do not review
the task of ultrasound with the PTA as they have performed the treatment many times
in the past and you are confident with their ability to safely use ultrasound. The PTA
states that they have reviewed the patient's chart and they do not have any conditions
that would be contraindicated when performing ultrasound.
Question: Based on this scenario, what did the physiotherapist do incorrectly?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Fail to review the task of ultrasound with the PTA.
B Have the PTA clear contraindications to determine if the task of ultrasound is safe.
Fail to check the ultrasound unit to see if it is in good working order.
D All of the above
This answer is incorrect. The correct answer is 'B' .
A. Fail to review the task of ultrasound with the PTA.
• The physiotherapist must ensure the PTA is competent in the application of the device
for the patient's condition.
• The physiotherapist does not have to review the actual task with the PTA if they are
confident that the PTA is competent.
• Given that they have worked together for several years and the PTA has performed the
task many times, the physiotherapist can be confident in their ability to safely apply
ultrasound.
B. Have the PTA clear contraindications to determine if the task of ultrasound is safe. - Best
a n s w e r
• It is up to the physiotherapist to determine if the patient is appropriate for the use of
the electrophysical agent.
• The physiotherapist must determine if there are contraindications or precautions by
either interviewing/assessing the patient or reviewing the chart.
• The PTA cannot determine if the use of the modality is safe or not.
C. Fail to check the ultrasound unit to see if it is in good working order.
• There is nothing in the vignette that states that the machine was not inspected.
• While this is an important step, it is not something that was highlighted in the vignette
(whether the machine was or was not inspected) and is therefore not something that
can be commented on.
• Always be sure to gather relevant information from the vignette when answering
questions.
D. All of the above
• Incorrect, A and C are not correct answers.
Clearly stated fees
It is up to the physiotherapists to make sure that patients understand the cost of service along with
any other additional fees for providing care.
• A written fee schedule for the following services must be stated clearly for the patient:
• Physiotherapy treatment (this includes an initial assessment and follow-up
appointments)
• Other services or products provided by the physiotherapist (e.g. short taping
appointment)
• Administrative tasks (e.g. photocopying a patient record, filling out forms)
• Penalties or interest charges for accounts owing (ie. sessions that have not been paid
for)
• It is the responsibility of the physiotherapist to ensure that patients are notified of
unpaid invoices.
• Charges for cancellations or missed appointments.
• Itemized receipts must be provided if requested by the patient at zero cost to the patient
or payer.
If the patient requests a refund for services not rendered, this must be done in a timely manner.
The financial record should include:
• Name of the patient
• All care providers, including PTA's
• Description of the care
• Product or service that was provided
• Date the service was provided
• Amount that was charged and received for the service
Packages and discounts
Physiotherapists have the option to 1) decrease their fees 2) waive fees entirely as long as it is the
physiotherapist's choice. An invoice should still be provided and must reflect the cost of service
(even if the service is $O).
Bundled services or packages can be provided but the patient must clearly understand the
following;
• What services are included in the bundle.
• The cost of each individual service in the bundle as well as the total cost of the bundle.
• This must also be clearly provided on the invoice or account.
• The option to receive a refund for any service in the bundle that was not provided.
• The patient has the option to buy each service individually.
With discount or bundled services, the standard of care must remain the same as what would be
provided for a full paying patient.
Exchanging services
Exchanging services should only be considered in extenuating circumstances, where the patient is
unable to pay. We have listed below all of the considerations that need to be fulfilled in order for
bartering to be warranted.
• The services must be relatively equal in value and their value must be agreed upon by both the
patient and the PT.
• The agreement is clearly laid out and agreed to before any trade occurs and the PT must make
it clear that if they choose to end the trade relationship, it will not affect their care.
• Al aspects of the agreement must be documented, including, the bartering agreement, how
risks are being managed, what is being exchanged and any discussions about the trade.
• Trading must not create a dual role for the patient - which almost always will happen.
• Trading must not create us prole/s one tend-which almost always wil happen.
We cannot imagine a situation on the exam where they would be able to create a scenario that
fulfills all of the requirements listed below. For that reason, we would avoid selecting an option that
suggests it is OK to trade services. Instead, you should consider lowering or waiving your fees.
Benefits fraud
The physiotherapist must ensure that they are invoicing for the actual services provided. When
services are incorrectly billed or performed, this can be classified as benefits fraud. Benefits fraud
could include:
• Extending a patient's treatment plan because they have a third party payer that will cover the
cost of services provided.
• For example, you are treating a patient after a motor vehicle accident for knee pain.
During the treatment process, the patient sprains their ankle. They advise you that they
do not have benefits. Their knee pain has resolved, but you continue to bill the third
party payer for the treatments provided for their ankle sprain as they do not have the
means to pay for treatment privately.
• Charging for services that were not provided.
• For example, you bill your mother's extended health program even though you have not
provided physiotherapy treatment.
• Charging for services that were not provided by the physiotherapist.
• For example, if a PTA provides the services, then the financial records should indicate
this.
Vignette: A rehabilitation facility has its clients assessed and re-assessed by a
physiotherapist. Subsequent sessions, however, are with a personal trainer who is
working as support personnel for the physiotherapist.
Question: Which of the following is correct regarding billing for sessions with the
support personnel?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Invoices should be submitted to the third-party payer using only the
physiotherapist's name and registration number.
Invoices should be submitted to the third-party payer using only the personal
trainer's name.
Invoices should be submitted to the third-party payer using the personal trainer's
name and can include the physiotherapist's name and registration number.
D None of the above
This a n s w e r i s c o r r e c t .
A. Invoices should be submitted to the third-party payer using only the physiotherapist's
name and registration number.
• Invoices must clearly indicate the individual who was providing treatment. Sessions
with the support personnel should be reflected in the invoice.
• While the physiotherapist's name and registration number may be included in the
invoice as they are overseeing the program, the invoice must indicate that the session
was with support personnel. Failing to do so is fraudulent.
B. Invoices should be submitted to the third-party payer using only the personal trainer's
n a m e .
• The physiotherapist's name and registration number may be included in the invoice as
they are overseeing the program
C. Invoices should be submitted to the third-party payer using the personal trainer's name
and can include the physiotherapist's name and registration number. - Best answer
D. None of the above
A. Pilates sessions can be billed as physiotherapy sessions if clients are paying privately as
there are no third-party payers involved.
• This is a false statement.
• It does not matter who is paying for the service, invoices must be accurate.
• If a client receives Pilates training that is not part of a physiotherapist's treatment plan,
they should be billed for Pilates. Anything different is fraudulent.
B. Physiotherapists cannot work as Pilates instructors.
• This is a false statement.
• Physiotherapists who are trained in Pilates can work as Pilates instructors. They must,
however, be clear in their treatment approach and bill appropriately for their sessions.
• For example:
• If the physiotherapist is using a few Pilates exercises during their physiotherapy
treatment to achieve a physiotherapy related goal (e.g., increased core strength
to decrease low back pain) and they are documenting using SOAP notes, then
the session can be billed as a physiotherapy session as the physiotherapist is just
using Pilates as a tool during the session.
• If the physiotherapist is teaching a 1:1 or group Pilates session, then the invoice
must reflect that.
C. Pilates sessions should never be billed as physiotherapy sessions. - Best answer
• This is a true statement.
• Invoices must be clear and transparent. If a client receives Pilates training that is not
part of a physiotherapist's treatment plan, they should be billed for Pilates. Anything
different is fraudulent.
D. B and C
Vignette: A physiotherapist, who is also a Pilates instructor, is providing 1:1 Pilates
sessions to a client. The patient is paying privately. The physiotherapist bills the Pilates
sessions as physiotherapy sessions to avoid having to edit their invoice.
Question: Based on the information presented in this scenario, which of the following
is a true statement?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Pilates sessions can be billed as physiotherapy sessions if clients are paying
privately as there are no third-party payers involved.
Physiotherapists cannot work as Pilates instructors.
C Pilates sessions should never be billed as physiotherapy sessions.
D B and C
Vignette: A physiotherapist is working with a patient whose treatment is funded by a
third-party payer due to an injury sustained at work. Initial rehabilitation consisted of
4, 1-hour sessions per week. The patient has really enjoyed physiotherapy and their
progress is going well. They could decrease to 2 sessions a week now that their pain
has subsided. The physiotherapist has quite a few gaps in their current schedule.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed with scheduling this patient?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Keep the patient at 4 days a week because they have the time, and the patient
enjoys their physiotherapy sessions.
Ask the patient if they would like to continue with 4 days a week.
Decrease the patient to 2 days a week.
D Discharge the patient because their pain has subsided and physiotherapy is no
longer indicated.
A. Keep the patient at 4 days a week because they have the time, and the patient enjoys their
physiotherapy sessions.
• This would be an example of benefits fraud.
• In this situation, while it doesn't hurt the patient to attend 4 days a week, the
physiotherapist is only doing so to fill their caseload as the patient is funded.
• Seeing a patient more than is necessary because they have funding through a third
party that will pay for services is fraudulent.
• Care should only be provided based on a patient's need, not based on what the third-
party payer will pay for.
• Under no circumstance should physiotherapists be helping patients defraud their
insurance company.
B. Ask the patient if they would like to continue with 4 days a week.
• The physiotherapist should decide the number of sessions a week based on the
patient's status and need.
• This is not something that the patient should decide upon because they could opt to
continue at 4 days a week out of enjoyment and not necessity.
C. Decrease the patient to 2 days a week.
• The physiotherapist should decrease the patient to 2 days a week based on their
recovery and look for new patients who need physiotherapy to fill the gaps in their
schedule.
D. Discharge the patient because their pain has subsided and physiotherapy is no longer
indicated.
• The vignette does not indicate that physiotherapy is no longer indicated.
• While their pain may have subsided, there could still be a need for physiotherapy to
work on things like strength, ROM and/or functional training.
Vignette: A patient who attends weekly physiotherapy sessions is reimbursed 70% by
their extended health plan. They are struggling financially and ask their
physiotherapist if their receipt can be made out for more than the cost of treatment so
that they can get all their money back each session.
Question: Which of the following is true regarding billing?
Choose only ONE best answer.
The receipt must reflect the exact cost of treatment and the amount paid by the
patient.
Receipts should only be issued once payment has been received.
C Receipts must also reflect the exact service that was provided (e.g., PT services vs
PTA services).
D All of the above
This a n s w e r i s c o r r e c t .
A. The receipt must reflect the exact cost of treatment and the amount paid by the patient.
B. Receipts should only be issued once payment has been received.
C. Receipts must also reflect the exact service that was provided (e.g., PT services vs PTA
services).
D. All of the above - Best answer
• In this situation, the physiotherapist would need to explain to the patient that the
receipt must reflect the exact cost of treatment and what was paid by the patient
because failure to do so is fraudulent.
Vignette: A patient who has been attending physiotherapy regularly for the last 3
months can no longer afford their weekly sessions. They feel their pain increases
significantly without weekly sessions and are concerned that they will regress without
physiotherapy. The patient offers to trade services for ongoing physiotherapy. They are
a talented seamstress and are happy to tailor some clothing for free for ongoing
weekly physiotherapy sessions.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Agree to the trade of services if the physiotherapist can decide on the final terms.
Agree to the trade of services if both the physiotherapist and patient are
comfortable with the agreement and it is of their own free will.
Offer to lower or waive the fees.
D Discharge the patient as they can no longer afford weekly sessions.
A. Agree to the trade of services if the physiotherapist can decide on the final terms.
• When exchanging services, the agreement should only be made if both parties are
comfortable with it. The physiotherapist does not get to decide on final terms.
B. Agree to the trade of services if both the physiotherapist and patient are comfortable with
the agreement and it is of their own free will.
• It is the physiotherapist's responsibility to ensure there is no exploitation of the
patient.
• Accepting this trade would create a dual relationship (i.e., a relationship that exists
within and outside of the therapeutic relationship), and this would blur professional
boundaries.
C. Offer to lower or waive the fees. - Best answer
• The physiotherapist should not agree to this trade of service because the trade
presented in this scenario would create a dual relationship. Instead, the
physiotherapist could offer to lower or waive their fees if this was something they felt
comfortable doing.
• If this occurred, the physiotherapist should document the agreement for
lowered/waived fees in the patient's chart and provide a receipt that reflects the
adjusted cost of the service.
D. Discharge the patient as they can no longer afford weekly sessions.
• Discharging the patient is not the best answer as the patient will still benefit from
services.
• The physiotherapist should come up with alternative options to help the patient if they
can no longer afford services.
For example: decrease cost of services, decrease sessions to every other week,
create a home exercise program, or bring on a PTA to help with the delivery of

Vignette: A physiotherapist recently changed jobs and moved from a salary position at
a local hospital to a contracted position at a private clinic. After several weeks at their
new job, the physiotherapist notices a potential discrepancy in their billing records. An
unknown patient's name is listed on their billing statement. The physiotherapist's
colleagues have told them that the receptionist who is responsible for billing is very
thorough and has been working in the office for over 10 years.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Do nothing as the receptionist has over 10 years of experience.
B Contact the College immediately.
Discuss the issue with the receptionist.
D Contact the patient listed on the billing statement.
A. Do nothing as the receptionist has over 10 years of experience.
• It is the responsibility of the physiotherapist to review their billings and accounts to
ensure that they are accurate.
• Even if someone else completes and submits invoices on their behalf (for example, a
receptionist), it is still the physiotherapist's responsibility to ensure their invoices are
accurate.
• If the physiotherapist finds an error, they must take action to correct the error.
B. Contact the College immediately.
• This would not be the first step in this scenario.
• If, however, the physiotherapist felt that there was a pattern of repeated billing issues
with the receptionist, they should contact their clinic manager and the College.
C. Discuss the issue with the receptionist. - Best answer
• This is the best answer and the most appropriate first step.
• The physiotherapist should reach out to discuss the issue with the receptionist
immediately so the matter can be investigated right away.
• The goal is to determine the reason for the error and determine a plan of action to
prevent the issue from re-occurring.
• If there was a billing error, the physiotherapist should follow up to ensure that the issue
w a s corrected.
• The physiotherapist should document the finding and what steps were taken to rectify
the situation.
D. Contact the patient listed on the billing statement.
• This would not be the most appropriate first step.
Vignette: A physiotherapist suspects that their colleague may be continuing care for
longer than it is necessary when they work with patients who have unlimited third-
party coverage for physiotherapy. The physiotherapist does not have any concrete
evidence to support their concerns.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Meet with management to discuss their concerns.
B Do nothing as they have no concrete evidence.
Confront their colleague.
D Report to the College.
A. Meet with management to discuss their concerns. - Best answer
• This will allow management to get involved to investigate further and determine if
their colleague is participating in benefits fraud.
B. Do nothing as they have no concrete evidence.
• The physiotherapist should not ignore what is happening as the potentially unethical
behaviour could have many negative consequences for the physiotherapy profession
and society.
• Despite having no concrete evidence, it would still be important to address their
concerns. By speaking to management, the physiotherapist will have brought
awareness to the issue.
C. Confront their colleague.
• The physiotherapist should not directly confront their colleague and should allow
management to investigate the issue.
D. Report to the College.
• While making a report to the College is not wrong, its not the best choice in this
scenario.
• At this point, going to management first may be the more appropriate action because
the physiotherapist only suspect benefits fraud and does not have any concrete
evidence to support that theory.
Vignette: A physiotherapist is working with a patient who mentions that they can no
longer afford their physiotherapy sessions. They have severe pain and benefit greatly
from their weekly sessions. The patient is concerned that they will regress without
ongoing treatment. The physiotherapist is in a difficult financial place and cannot
afford to provide services at a discounted rate.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Discuss alternative treatment options (e.g., working with a PTA or a home exercise
program).
Offer a reduction in fee as the patient will benefit from ongoing physiotherapy
sessions.
Ask a colleague if they are willing to continue to treat the patient for a discounted
rate.
D Advise the patient that physiotherapists cannot offer discounts on services as it
can negatively affect the quality of care being delivered.
A. Discuss alternative treatment options (e.g., working with a PTA or a home exercise
program).
• If a patient states that they can no longer pay for treatment, and the physiotherapist
does not want to offer services at a discounted rate, they should openly discuss
alternative treatment options (e.g., working with a PTA or a home exercise program)
and what treatments are a priority for their specific situation.
• They should work with the patient to ensure the patient is able to make an informed
decision about what treatment (if any) they would like to receive based on what they
can afford.
B. Offer a reduction in fee as the patient will benefit from ongoing physiotherapy sessions.
• Physiotherapists are not required to offer fee reductions if a patient cannot pay for
their treatment.
• They can choose to offer a reduction in the cost of services but only if this is something
that they are comfortable with and they have approval from clinic management.
• Based on this scenario, this is not the best answer as the vignette states that the
physiotherapist is not in a financial position to offer discounted services.
C. Ask a colleague if they are willing to continue to treat the patient for a discounted rate.
• This is not the best answer for many reasons such as:
• The physiotherapist has not yet provided alternative options for the patient such
as working with a PTA, focusing on a home exercise program, using modalities at
home (e.g., TENS), decreasing sessions to bi-weekly or monthly etc.
• The physiotherapist should not directly refer to their colleague without giving
the patient choice in a care provider.
• The colleague may also not be an appropriate fit for the patient based on
skill/knowledge level.
• This puts a tremendous amount of pressure on the colleague which is
• This puts a tremendous amount of pressure on the colleague which is
unprofessional.
D. Advise the patient that physiotherapists cannot offer discounts on services as it can
negatively affect the quality of care being delivered.
• This statement is false.
• Physiotherapists have the option to 1) decrease their fees 2) waive fees entirely as long
as it is the physiotherapist's choice.
• An invoice should still be provided and must reflect the cost of service (even if the
service is $O).
• With discounted services, the standard of care must remain the same as what would be
provided for a full paying patient.
Liability insurance
Definition of liability insurance: insurance that provides an insured party with protection against at
fault claims or negligence resulting in bodily harm or financial loss. It also covers expenses incurred
by the insured in the event of prosecution, such as legal representation costs and compensation
paid to the patient.
To register with the College, you need liability insurance. It is the physiotherapist's responsibility to
ensure the following:
They either arrange to pay for the insurance themselves or have it paid for by their employer.
• Their insurance covers each location they work at if they practice in multiple environments.
• They are able to provide proof of insurance within 30 days if requested by their provincial
College.
Registering with the college
Physiotherapists must be registered with their provincial College and maintain accurate information
at all times throughout their career.
• After registering, the physiotherapist will receive a registration number that is unique. This
number will stay with them throughout their career. This number is used for billing purposes.
Any changes to the following must be updated on their College registrant profile:
• Home and/or business address
• Telephone number or email
• Name
• Any information previously provided to the College
ignette: Over the last 3 years, a physiotherapist has been working part time as an
mployee at a local hospital. Since her youngest is now in school, the physiotherapist
has decided to increase her work hours by applying to a private practice clinic where
she will work part time as a contractor.
Question: How should the physiotherapy proceed with respect to her liability
insurance to ensure she is adequately covered at both locations?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Before beginning her position at the private practice clinic, apply for liability
insurance through Canadian Physiotherapy Association (CPA) or a private
insurance company.
Do nothing. She has liability insurance as she is already a practicing
physiotherapist.
Contact her College to get the liability insurance she requires.
D Wait until the first day at her new position and discuss insurance options with the
clinic manager.
A. Before beginning her position at the private practice clinic, apply for liability insurance
through the Canadian Physiotherapy Association (CPA) or a private insurance company. -
B e s t a n s w e r
• Physiotherapists MUST have liability insurance to practice and this must be in place
before starting any physiotherapy position.
• Insurance is typically provided and covered for employees who work in a public setting
such as a hospital but it is always the physiotherapist's responsibility to ensure that it
is in place.
• As a contractor in a private clinic, physiotherapists are typically responsible for
arranging and paying for insurance themselves. CPA offers insurance to its members or
there are private insurance companies who offer coverage (e.g., PhysioSure).
B. Do nothing. She has liability insurance as she is already a practicing physiotherapist.
• Physiotherapists who work in multiple practice environments (at many clinics and/or
hospitals), cannot assume their insurance at one location covers them for other
practice environments.
C. Contact her College to get the liability insurance she requires.
• Provincial Colleges do not provide liability insurance.
D. Wait until the first day at her new position and discuss insurance options with the clinic
manager.
• Waiting until the first day on the job is too late.
• The physiotherapist must have insurance coverage before the first day on the job.
This answer is incorrect. The correct answer is 'D'.
A. Contact their provincial College and discontinue liability insurance.
• Liability insurance is still required while on leave to ensure the physiotherapist is
covered for any complaints that might surface from previous patient interactions.
B. Inform their workplace of the duration of their absence.
• This answer is not wrong, however, it is not the best answer as it does not highlight the
importance of ensuring the College is aware of the physiotherapist's extended leave.
C. Contact the Canadian Physiotherapy Association (CPA) and their provincial College.
• This answer is not wrong, however, it is not the best answer as it does not highlight the
importance of ensuring the PT has insurance coverage even while on leave.
• If a PT is a member of CPA, they can contact the association and get a percentage
refunded in their annual membership.
D. Contact their provincial College and ensure liability insurance coverage is in place while on
leave. - Best answer
• This is the best answer as it highlights the importance of ensuring the College is aware
of the physiotherapist's extended leave and that the physiotherapist has insurance
coverage even while on leave.
Vignette: A physiotherapist at a private practice clinic had their license suspended due
to repeated privacy breaches. This physiotherapist was the main financial support for
their family and brought in the greatest amount of revenue for the clinic. After a long
talk with the clinic owner, it was decided that the physiotherapist could continue to
practice if they followed all privacy regulations. To bill, they had the administration
department use the owner's name and registration number when billing. Patients
were not notified that the physiotherapist was under suspension.
Question: Who is at fault here?
Choose only ONE best answer.
The clinic owner
B The physiotherapist
The administration
D All of the above
This a n s w e r i s c o r r e c t .
A. The clinic owner
B. The physiotherapist
C. The administration
D. All of the above
• Everyone involved is at fault.
• The physiotherapist cannot work as a physiotherapist with a suspended license. There
is no flexibility or exceptions here at all.
• This should be reported immediately to the College.
Requirements to fulfill when leaving a practice
Before leaving a job, going on temporary leave, or retiring, physiotherapists must do the following:
• Remind their employer that after they leave, their registration number should no longer be
used for billing purposes.
• Create a plan for patients who need ongoing care. For example:
• Discharge with a home program.
• Arrange transfer to a colleague or physiotherapist at a different clinic.
• Stop physiotherapy care being provided by PTAs unless another physiotherapist is available
and has agreed to supervise the care.
• Ensure all patient records are up to date including next steps for care.
• Ensure personal liability insurance meets the College requirements including tail insurance if
retiring/going on leave.
• Tail insurance ensures that you have coverage for any claims made against you after you
stop practicing.
• The duration of tail insurance varies from province to province. The time required is not
examinable, but it is important to know you need insurance coverage after retiring or
going on leave.
• Notify the College of leave or job change within 30 days.
Updates to registrant's college profile
If going on going on maternity, parental, or extended leave, the physiotherapist must update the
College. If going on leave, there are 2 options:
1. Resign registration: this option is applicable if you are not planning to work as a
physiotherapist or use the title physiotherapist.
• With this option, you must contact your College to notify them that your information is
changing.
• A credit for registration time remaining will be paid out.
2. Remain registered:
• With this option, you still must let the College know that you will be taking leave by
updating the information in your registrant profile. Updated information should include:
• Last d a t e at work
• Updated contact details if applicable
• This is so the College can reach you during your absence if necessary.
Insurance coverage is needed when taking leave even if a PT is not practicing.
When returning from maternity, parental, or extended leave, the PT needs to contact the College at
least two weeks before returning to work to complete the necessary documentation.
Vignette: A physiotherapist has decided to leave their position at a local hospital and

physiotherapy assistants (PTA) regularly for patient care.
Question: Which of the following is not essential for the physiotherapist to do before
leaving their current practice?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Notify the College of a job change within 30 days.
Stop physiotherapy care for all patients working with a PTA unless another
physiotherapist is available and has agreed to supervise the care.
C Ensure patient records are up to date.
D Discharge all patients from active care and provide a home exercise program.
A. Notify the College of a job change within 30 days.
• This is essential for the physiotherapist to do before leaving their current practice.
B. Stop physiotherapy care for all patients working with a PTA unless another physiotherapist
is available and has agreed to supervise the care.
• This is essential for the physiotherapist to do before leaving their current practice.
C. Ensure patient records are up to date.
• This is essential for the physiotherapist to do before leaving their current practice.
D. Discharge all patients from active care and provide a home exercise program. - Best
a n s w e r
• This is not essential for the physiotherapist to do before leaving their current practice.
• Physiotherapists must ensure there is a plan in place for patients who need ongoing
care. While it may be appropriate for some clients to be discharged from active care
with a home exercise program, others may require ongoing therapy and should be
transferred to a colleague or provided with names of other physiotherapy clinics in the
a r e a .
A. The physiotherapist does not need to notify the College of their maternity leave because
their registration status has not changed.
• This is a false statement.
• The College needs to be notified of any change to employment status.
• If going on temporary leave (e.g., maternity leave) or changing jobs, the
physiotherapist must notify the College within 30 days.
B. A physiotherapist going on maternity leave cannot keep their registration active as they
are not practicing.
• This is a false statement.
• If going on leave, there are 2 options:
• Resign registration:
• This option is applicable if the physiotherapist is not planning to work as a
physiotherapist or use the title physiotherapist.
• With this option, they must contact their College to notify them that their
information is changing.
• Remain registered:
• With this option, the physiotherapist must still let the College know that
they will be taking leave by updating the information in their registrant
profile.
C. Insurance coverage is needed when taking a leave even if the physiotherapist is not
practicing. - Best answer
• This is a true statement.
• This is to cover any claims made against the physiotherapist by past patients while
they are away on maternity leave.
D. When returning from maternity leave, the physiotherapist needs to contact the College the
day before their first shift to notify them of their return.
D. When returning from maternity leave, the physiotherapist needs to contact the Colege the
day before their first shift to notify them of their return.
• This is a false statement.
• When returning from maternity leave, the physiotherapist needs to contact the College
at least two weeks before returning to work to complete the necessary documentation.
Vignette: A physiotherapist returning from their maternity leave forgets to contact the
College and reinstate their registration to active. They are, however, a member of the
Canadian Physiotherapy Association (CPA).
Question: Which of the following statements is false?
Choose only ONE best answer.
The physiotherapist can still practice if they are a member of CPA and have
liability insurance through them.
It is optional to be a member of CPA.
Physiotherapists practicing in Canada must be registered with their provincial

and the registration must be in an active registration/ member status.
B. It is optional to be a member of CPA.
• This is a true statement.
• It is optional to be a member of CPA - it is not mandatory.
C. Physiotherapists practicing in Canada must be registered with their provincial College.
• This is a true s t a t e m e n t .
D. Physiotherapist's College registration number stays with them throughout their career.
• This is a true statement.
• After registering with the College, the physiotherapist wil receive a registration number
that is unique. This number wil stay with them throughout their career. This number is
used for billing purposes.
Responsibilities
It is the responsibility of the physiotherapist to ensure the accuracy of how their name and
registration number are being used. The physiotherapist must:
• Never charge a fee or create a receipt that is inaccurate or misleading.
• Review receipts invoiced and submitted on behalf of the physiotherapist.
• For example, a receipt created by a receptionist at a private clinic setting. Every receipt
does not need to be reviewed, however, every receipt is the responsibility of the
physiotherapist. It is recommended to review invoices regularly. It is recommended to
create your own system to review invoices and direct billing for accuracy.
• Only charge one payer for the cost of the physiotherapy session.
• Review their billings and accounts to make sure that they are accurate. Review for accuracy of
the following:
• Registration number
• Physiotherapist's name
• Date of treatment
• Cost for service
• Patient's name
If the physiotherapist finds an error, they must correct the error, document the finding, and state
what actions were taken to rectify the situation.
Disclosing self-harm
If a patient discloses abuse, self-harm, or suicidal thoughts, stop your assessment/treatment and
address these comments. Don't ignore the patient's comments.
• Stay within your scope of practice by responding to the concerning comments:
• Ask a few questions to get an idea of the degree of danger and then decide on the course
of action.
• Is this a statement due to stress?
• Do they have a suicide plan?
• Is this something they have attempted before?
• Do they have anyone to talk to?
• Let the patient know that you are concerned about them.
• Encourage them to talk to someone.
• Refer the patient to the appropriate professionals/resources:
• Offer resource information.
• Crisis lines are great resources for patients.
• Refer to a counselor, social worker, or back to their family physician.
• Maintain patient confidentiality unless:
• The adult is at significant risk of harm.
• If you are concerned that the patient is in imminent danger (based on your
judgment of the situation), then a cal to 911 may be the best option.
• You may also call a crisis line for guidance on how to proceed with a certain
situation.
• Let the patient know you are breaking confidentiality and are doing this out of
serious concern and for their own wellbeing.
• The person reporting the thoughts of self-harm/suicide is a minor - even if you have
deemed them a mature minor.
• Document relevant information and actions taken in clinical records.
QUESTION 1 OF 3
Vignette: A 38-year-old male patient is attending physiotherapy at a private clinic for
treatment of post concussion syndrome following a car accident 4 months ago. His
wife attends most sessions and plays an active role in his care. During the initial
assessment, the patient provided consent for his wife to be involved in all
conversations regarding their care. The patient is suffering from chronic headaches,
visual disturbances, balance issues and fatigue. He is currently not working because
his job, as a construction worker, is very strenuous.
Question: During a recent visit, the patient pulls the physiotherapist aside and states
that they are not doing well and have been having suicidal thoughts. They describe, in
detail, the plans of how they plan to kill themselves. What should the physiotherapist
do?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Stop treatment immediately and address the patient's comments. Ask them more
questions about their suicidal thoughts while staying within their scope of
practice.
Stop treatment immediately and address the patient's comments. Assume they
are in imminent danger and call a suicide hotline to determine the best course of
action.
Stop treatment immediately and advise their spouse of their comments.
D R e f e r t h e p a t i e n t f o r c o u n s e l i n g a n d r e f e r b a c k t o t h e i r f a m i l v d o c t o r .
This answer is incorrect. The correct answer is 'B' .
A. Stop treatment immediately and address the patient's comments. Ask them more
questions about their suicidal thoughts while staying within their scope of practice.
• This situation is at a highly escalated level and would not be within the
physiotherapist's scope at this point in time. It would be advised to get help for the
patient immediately.
B. Stop treatment immediately and address the patient's comments. Assume they are in
imminent danger and call a suicide hotline to determine the best course of action. - Best
a n s w e r
• It is safe to assume that this patient is in imminent danger and calling a suicide hotline
would be in the patient's best interest.
C. Stop treatment immediately and advise their spouse of their comments.
• While not incorrect, given the severity of the situation, this is not the best option.
D. Refer the patient for counseling and refer back to their family doctor.
• Given the severity of the situation, this would not be an appropriate action.
Q U E S T I O N LOrS
Vignette: A physiotherapist is working with a 24-year-old patient who suffered a distal
radioulnar fracture 5 months ago. The patient developed complex regional pain
syndrome which has slowed their recovery. During one of the sessions, the patient
reports that they have occasional thoughts of suicide. Through some probing
questions, the physiotherapist learns that the patient does not want to end their life.
They have no plans to act on the thoughts of suicide and are just feeling frustrated
about their injury. They would like to keep the conversation confidential.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Encourage the patient to talk to someone and offer resources.
B Express that they are concerned about the patient.
Do nothing, the patient's life is not in danger.
D Immediately call the crisis line to create a plan of action.
This answer is correct.
A. Encourage the patient to talk to someone and offer resources. - Best answer
• The vignette has clarified that the physiotherapist does not feel that the patient's life is
in imminent danger so they should not break confidentiality.
• The physiotherapist should encourage the patient to talk to someone and provide
resources for professionals in the area.
B. Express that they are concerned about the patient.
• While this is not incorrect, it is not the best answer.
• Given the thoughts of suicide, the physiotherapist should encourage the patient to talk
to a professional and offer them local resources.
C. Do nothing, the patient's life is not in danger.
• While the patient's life is not in imminent danger, the physiotherapist should still
encourage the patient to talk to someone.
• Doing nothing is not in the patient's best interest.
D. Immediately call the crisis line to create a plan of action.
• The patient would like to keep the conversation confidential. Breaking confidentiality
and calling a crisis line is only appropriate if the physiotherapist feels that the patient's
life is in imminent danger.
Vignette: A physiotherapist is working with a 16-year-old patient who is deemed a
mature minor. The patient plays competitive tennis and recently developed tennis
elbow. During one of the sessions, the patient reports that they have been feeling a lot
of pressure in their life and have occasional thoughts of suicide. They would like to
keep the conversation confidential.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Encourage the patient to talk to someone and offer resources.
B Gain consent from the patient to disclose the comments to their legal guardian.
C Ask some probing questions to gather more information and document the
interaction.
D Call the crisis line to create a plan of action.
This answer is incorrect. The correct answer is 'D' .
A. Encourage the patient to talk to someone and offer resources.
• While this answer is not wrong, it is not the best answer as it does not highlight that the
physiotherapist must disclose this information because the patient is a minor.
• The physiotherapist must break confidentiality if the person reporting thoughts of self-
harm/suicide is a minor - even if they have been deemed a mature minor. It does not
matter if the physiotherapist feels the minor's life is in imminent danger or not, the
information must be disclosed to their guardian and/or physician.
• If there is an immediate risk, the physiotherapist should call emergency services.
B. Gain consent from the patient to disclose the comments to their legal guardian.
• Consent is not required in this scenario as the physiotherapist is concerned about the
minor's welfare. They can break confidentiality and disclose the information to the
patient's guardian and/or physician.
C. Ask some probing questions to gather more information and document the interaction.
• While this answer is not wrong, it is not the best answer.
• The physiotherapist should ask the patient some questions related to their suicidal
thoughts and should document the interaction, but they also need to break
confidentiality and report because the patient is a minor.
D. Call the crisis line to create a plan of action. - Best answer
• Breaking confidentiality and calling a crisis line is the best option listed because the
patient is a minor. The physiotherapist can break confidentiality and call a crisis line for
guidance in addition to contacting the patient's guardian and/or physician.
Pillars of providing tele-rehabilitation
Tele-rehabilitation, sometimes referred to as virtual care, has become more widely known since the
pandemic. It is defined as the delivery of physiotherapy services at a distance, using
telecommunications technology as the service delivery medium.
• Tele-rehabilitation may be appropriate if a patient cannot easily attend in-person sessions
b e c a u s e of issues like:
• A shortage of physiotherapists in their region
• Transportation or mobility issues
• Health pandemic that discourages physical contact
• As regulated health professionals, physiotherapists must use their judgement to decide if
virtual practice is an appropriate way to deliver safe and effective care to their patient.
• Virtual appointments must include all elements of providing care. See "Elements of providing
care" under the section Providing or Refusing Care.
• Physiotherapists must be registered in their province to provide tele-rehabilitation to patients
living in that same province.
• For example, a physiotherapist living in Ontario treating a patient in Ontario must be
registered as an Ontario physiotherapist.
• A physiotherapist living in Alberta, treating a patient in Ontario, must be registered as an
Ontario physiotherapist.
• Physiotherapists must use their professional judgement to determine:
• Whether tele-rehabilitation is the most appropriate method to deliver services
considering the circumstances.
• Whether a direct physical examination is required to complete the assessment and
determine a physiotherapy diagnosis and treatment plan.
• Whether they can deliver substantially similar care as physiotherapy delivered face-to-
face.
• Whether patient factors such as physical, sensory, or cognitive deficits may impact the
ability to deliver appropriate care through tele-rehabilitation.
Whether patient factors such as physical, sensory, or cognitive deficits may impact the
ility to deliver appropriate care through tele-rehabilitation.
• Records (including receipts and charts) must indicate that physiotherapy services were
provided through tele-rehabilitation.
• Physiotherapists must comply with privacy legislation and are accountable for the privacy and
security of patient's health information.
• Physiotherapists must obtain informed consent for tele-rehabilitation.
• Physiotherapists must have an adverse event plan in place should a patient experience an
emergency during a tele-rehabilitation physiotherapy session.
Vignette: A physiotherapist is reading the initial intake form for a patient whom they
will be treating virtually. The therapist notices that the patient recently moved to a
new province and no longer lives in the same province as the physiotherapist.
Question: Which of the following statements is correct?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Physiotherapists assessing or treating patients residing in another province must
be registered to practice in that province.
B As regulated health professionals across Canada, the physiotherapist can treat a
patient virtually from anywhere.
Since the appointment will be virtual, the change in location doesn't affect the
physiotherapist's ability to provide care.
D The physiotherapist may not be able to work under the same scope of practice
since the patient does not live in the same province as the therapist.
This a n s w e r is correct.
A. Physiotherapists assessing or treating patients residing in another province must be
registered to practice in that province. - Best answer
• This statement is correct.
B. As regulated health professionals across Canada, the physiotherapist can treat a patient
virtually from anywhere.
• This statement is incorrect. You must be registered as a physiotherapist in the same
province as the patient you are treating.
C. Since the appointment will be virtual, the change in location doesn't affect the
physiotherapist's ability to provide care.
• This statement is incorrect.
D. The physiotherapist may not be able to work under the same scope of practice since the
patient does not live in the same province as the therapist.
• This statement is incorrect. The physiotherapist will not be able to work at all.
Vignette: A physiotherapist is working with a patient who is 1-week post left total hip
replacement (posterior-lateral approach). The patient has been receiving services from
the physiotherapist virtually as they have not been cleared to drive. The patient was
given a booklet of exercises when they were discharged from the hospital and have
been completing them each day. During their last virtual session, the patient reported
they have progressed through the first set of exercises that were provided in the
hospital and would like to receive more challenging exercises. The physiotherapist
prescribes more challenging exercises but is unable to give proper feedback as the
video connection is poor. At the next visit, the patient states that they have pain in
their left hip. They deny having a fever, feeling unwell, or noticing any redness in the
surgical area.
Question: Which of the following is the most ethical way for the physiotherapist to
proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
If possible, ask the patient to attend an in-person session so the therapist could
give proper exercise feedback.
Refer the patient to their family doctor as there may be an infection.
Advise the patient to go to the emergency room as soon as possible and
document the interaction.
D Refer the patient back to their surgeon.
This a n s w e r is correct.
A. If possible, ask the patient to attend an in-person session so the therapist could give
proper exercise feedback. - Best answer
• It would be best if the patient could come in for treatment so the physiotherapist could
evaluate her exercises and see if any changes could be made to decrease the pain in
her hip. Pain is normal at 1 week post surgery, especially if they are doing too much.
The physiotherapist could also look to see if there are any signs of infection and, if
needed, refer to her doctor.
B. Refer the patient to their family doctor as there may be an infection.
• The patient denies signs of infection, so it is unlikely this is the cause. The patient is
only 1 week post surgery, incision site pain is normal at this stage of healing.
C. Advise the patient to go to the emergency room as soon as possible and document the
interaction.
• The situation does not seem emergent. Incisional pain is normal 1 week post surgery.
D. Refer the patient back to their surgeon.
• Same rationale as sending back to the family physician.
Vignette: A physiotherapist meets a patient for an initial assessment online. The
patient has recently been discharged home after suffering a stroke. The patient is
unable to drive to a clinic and has chosen the option of telehealth. The patient wants
to work on improving their gait pattern and balance while ambulating. They live with
their spouse who is in poor health and cannot assist during the sessions. During the
assessment, the patient attempts to ambulate but seems very unstable. The
physiotherapist asks the patient to remain seated as they appear unstable. The patient
is frustrated and states that they thought the whole point of the physiotherapy
sessions would be to learn how to walk again and that they want to practice walking
during their session.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Provide more cueing during the virtual sessions to increase safety while the
patient practices ambulation.
B Discharge the patient from physiotherapy as virtual sessions are unsafe.
C Encourage the spouse and patient to set up the environment in a manner that will
increase safety.
D Discuss alternative options such as in-person physiotherapy.
This a n s w e r is correct.
A. Provide more cueing during the virtual sessions to increase safety while the patient
practices ambulation.
This is not the best option as verbal cueing cannot guarantee the patient's safety.
B. Discharge the patient from physiotherapy as virtual sessions are unsafe.
• The patient may not be appropriate for virtual physiotherapy, but they still require
physiotherapy services. For this reason, the physiotherapist must look into alternative
options for the patient.
C. Encourage the spouse and patient to set up the environment in a manner that will increase
safety.
• This is not the best option as the vignette has already mentioned that the spouse is ill
and unable to help.
It also does not guarantee that the patient will be safe during sessions. If the patient is
unsteady and at risk of a fall, the best course of action is in-person care until they are
more stable and can participate in virtual sessions safely.
D. Discuss alternative options such as in-person physiotherapy. - Best answer
• This is a situation where the best care may not be provided virtually.
• If the patient wishes to practice walking but is not safe to do so independently, then
the best course of action is to look into in-person physiotherapy in the home. This way,
the patient can work on their goals in a safe manner with a physiotherapist present.
If the physiotherapist does not offer in-home physiotherapy services, then they should
look into local options for home physiotherapy and provide the patient with these
r e s o u r c e s .
PHIPA, HIC, IPC
Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA)
• Physiotherapists must follow the rules of the Personal Health Information Protection Act
(PHIPA).
• PHIPA governs the collection, use and disclosure of personal health information by Health
Information Custodians (HIC).
Health Information Custodian (HIC)
• A HIC is responsible for collecting, using, and disclosing personal health information on behalf
of clients. A HIC is also responsible for storing and disposing of health information in a secure
manner.
• A HIC can be an institution (e.g., hospital, long-term care home, pharmacy) or a private
healthcare practitioner (e.g., PT, OT).
• The term 'agent' is used to define any person who is authorized by a HIC (e.g., hospital
or long-term care home) to perform services on the HIC's behalf. The agent must comply
with PHIPA and follow the policies set in place by the HIC for whom they work.
• In a hospital setting where the hospital itself is the HIC, a physiotherapist working
in the hospital is considered an 'agent' of the HIC.
• A physiotherapist working as the sole practitioner in their own practice is
considered the HIC.
• In a private practice setting with multiple practitioners, there must be clear
documentation to identify who the HIC is - it could be the physiotherapist
themselves, the clinic owner, or the clinic/agency itself. Thus, when working in
private practice, you may be the HIC or an 'agent' depending on the policies set in
place by the clinic you work for.
Information & Privacy Commissioner (IPC)
Information & Privacy Commissioner (IPC)
• Each province and territory in Canada have a commissioner responsible for overseeing and
enforcing provincial and territory privacy legislation.
This a n s w e r i s correct.
A. Look up their family friend's chart and keep all findings private.
• The physiotherapist is not in the patient's circle of care and cannot look at the patient's
files.
• Inappropriately accessing a patient's health information when not involved in their
care can result in suspension or termination.
B. Liaise with their colleague.
• The physiotherapist should not be trying to gather information about their friend from
their colleague as they are not within the patient's circle of care. Their colleague is not
allowed to share the patient's information.
C. Contact their friend's spouse. - Best answer
• This is the best answer.
• The physiotherapist needs to act as a friend and avoid breaking any privacy laws. They
can touch base with their friend's spouse for updates on their friend's status or go visit
their friend in the hospital.
D. Try to attend daily rounds on the other floor to get updated information on their friend's
status.
• The physiotherapist should not be trying to gather information about their friend as
they are not within the patient's circle of care. By doing so, they are violating their
friend's privacy.
Vignette: A physiotherapist is working their first day at a private practice clinic, taking
ver maternity leave. They log into the online computer charting system to look up
their patients for the day. By accident, due to two patients having the same last name,
they open the wrong record and begin to read another patient's health records. Once
they realize their mistake, they immediately close the patient's record and search for
their patient's records.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Report the privacy breach to the College.
B Report the privacy breach to the Information & Privacy Commissioner.
Report the privacy breach to the patient.
D Keep the patient information private and pay more attention in the future when
looking up patient files.
T h i s a n s w e r i s c o r r e c t .
A. Report the privacy breach to the College.
• The privacy breach was an accident, not intentional and happened once.
• It is not necessary to report to the College.
B. Report the privacy breach to the Information & Privacy Commissioner.
• The privacy breach was an accident, not intentional and happened once.
• It is not necessary to report to the Information & Privacy Commissioner (IPC).
C. Report the privacy breach to the patient.
• In terms of reporting the breach to the patient, it would not be wrong to let the patent
know about the breach however, given the scale and nature of the breach as well as
the physiotherapist's intentions, it would not be mandatory to report to the patient
either.
D. Keep the patient information private and pay more attention in the future when looking
up patient files. - Best answer
• This is the best answer given this scenario.
• The privacy breach was an accident, not intentional and happened once.
• In a situation like this, it's important for the physiotherapist to learn from their mistake
by analyzing what happened and determining ways to prevent a repeated breach in
the future.
Vignette: A physiotherapist in a private practice clinic still uses paper charting. They
decide to bring their patient's chart home for the weekend to finish up a large report
that is due Monday. On their way home, they stop at the grocery store and leave the
charts in the passenger seat. When they get back to their car, they notice that the
passenger window is broken and all the small items in their car, including the patient's
chart, are missing.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
File a police report.
B Report the privacy breach to the College and the Information & Privacy
Commissioner.
C Report the loss of the file to the clinic and make a reasonable attempt to find the
chart.
D All of the above
This a n s w e r i s correct.
A. File a police report.
• The physiotherapist's car has been broken into and property stolen so they should file
a police report.
B. Report the privacy breach to the College and the Information & Privacy Commissioner.
• Even though this was an accidental, one-time privacy breach, the patient's chart was
stolen so this becomes a situation where you must notify the College and IPC.
C. Report the loss of the file to the clinic and make a reasonable attempt to find the chart.
• In this situation, the physiotherapist must report the loss of the file to the clinic and
make a reasonable attempt to find the chart (e.g., walk/drive around the local area to
see if it has been tossed to the ground).
D. All of the above - Best answer
• In addition to all answers listed above, the physiotherapist should also do the
following:
• Notify the patient of the privacy breach, the steps taken to contain the breach or
locate the lost chart, and the fact that they may make a complaint to the
Information and Privacy Commissioner (IPC).
• Review privacy policies with the clinic and determine if these policies were
followed.
• Review policies and procedures to correct any flaws in the actual policies
or errors made by the physiotherapist to ensure the breach is not repeated.
• Document findings of this review and the breach itself.
Vignette: A physiotherapist is working with a patient who is recovering from a brain
injury. Due to the extent of their injuries, their driver's license was taken away. The
patient is going to begin driver rehabilitation with a local company to determine if they
are safe to resume driving and if any adaptive aids are required. The patient provides
verbal consent for you to send the health information related to their physical abilities
to the driver rehabilitation expert.
Question: Which of the following statements is correct?
Choose only ONE best answer.
The physiotherapist can send the health information as verbal consent is enough.
The physiotherapist requires written consent to release the health information as
verbal consent is not enough.
The physiotherapist cannot release any information as the driver rehabilitation
expert is not within the patient's circle of care.
D The physiotherapist requires both written and verbal consent to release the health
information.
A. The physiotherapist can send the health information as verbal consent is enough. - Best
a n s w e r
• Written consent is not required here.
• The patient may consent verbally.
• The physiotherapist should ensure they document in the patient's chart that verbal
consent was obtained for the release of information to the driver rehabilitation
specialist.
B. The physiotherapist requires written consent to release the health information as verbal
consent is not enough.
• The patient may consent verbally.
C. The physiotherapist cannot release any information as the driver rehabilitation expert is
not within the patient's circle of care.
• The physiotherapist can release the patient's information to anyone outside of the
patient's circle of care as long as the patient has provided consent for them to do so.
D. The physiotherapist requires both written and verbal consent to release the health
information.
• Written consent is not required here.
• The patient may consent verbally.
Vignette: A physiotherapist recently started working at a private practice clinic. The
clinic's treatment rooms are separated by thin curtains. While treating a patient, the
ysiotherapist can clearly hear their colleague's patient disclosing personal
information a b o u t their health.
Question: Given this breach of privacy, what should be the first action of the
physiotherapist?
Choose only ONE best answer.
A Contact the College to report the breach.
B Meet with the clinic manager to report the privacy issue.
C Inform the colleague that their conversation was overheard and suggest that they
speak quieter during treatment sessions.
D Inform the patient that the conversation was overheard.
This answer is incorrect. The correct answer is 'B'.
A. Contact the College to report the breach.
• This would not be the first step in managing this privacy issue. Other steps should be
taken first such as speaking to management to resolve the problem.
• If, however, the issue is not addressed by management and the privacy issue
continues, contacting the College for proper direction would be the next step.
B. Meet with the clinic manager to report the privacy issue. - Best answer
• The clinical environment should be set up in a manner that maximizes patient privacy.
• If this is not the case, then adjustments must be made.
• By speaking to management, the issue of privacy can be addressed directly and these
adjustments can be made. Examples of changes that could be made to improve privacy
in this scenario include:
• Turn o n a m b i e n t music to lessen noise
• Increase the distance between curtained areas
• Adjust clinic policy and ensure physiotherapists space themselves out and never
work side by side
C. Inform the colleague that their conversation was overheard and suggest that they speak
quieter during treatment sessions.
• Asking the colleague to speak quieter does not address the clinic setup and resulting
privacy issues. The environment needs to be changed to improve privacy.
D. Inform the patient that the conversation was overheard.
• While this is not incorrect, it is not the best answer as it does not provide a solution to
the greater issue at hand - the environment setup causing privacy issues.
What is sexual misconduct?
Physiotherapists must always maintain professional boundaries with patients. Being found guilty of
sexual abuse can result in the loss of the ability to practice as a physiotherapist in Canada.
Sexual abuse is defined as any form of physical, verbal, or behavioural interaction by the
physiotherapist towards the patient that is not clinically appropriate to the services provided.
Professional misconduct of a sexual nature includes:
• Having sexual intercourse with a patient.
• Engaging in any form of physical sexual relationship with a patient.
• Touching a patient in a sexual nature
• Making a sexual remark to a patient

Act in the patient's best interest
The physiotherapist is responsible for managing boundaries to ensure that the relationship is always
therapeutic/professional. The therapeutic boundary is critical because if it is not maintained,
professional judgement can be impaired. Physiotherapists must recognize the following in order to
maintain professional boundaries:
• Recognize that there is not one way to act. Patient's will each have unique boundaries
depending on their personal experiences, history of trauma, age, values, gender, or culture.
• Physiotherapists should not ask for gifts. It may be acceptable to accept a gift that shows a
token of appreciation. These gifts are often given at socially appropriate times (e.g., holidays,
end of treatment).
• You should consider:
• The intent behind the gift.
• If the gift will affect your clinical decision making.
• If the gift will change the nature of the relationship.
• If the gift is appropriate:
• Appropriate: a small gift to show appreciation for the treatment.
• Inappropriate: a gift that will hopefully make you treat them longer or
outside of your regular schedule, or provide better care.
• Know that an intimate or romantic relationship with a patient oversteps the therapeutic
boundary and is not allowed.
• When it comes to former patients, the physiotherapist can enter into an intimate or
romantic relationship if the following apply:
• Significant time has passed since their discharge
• There is no imbalance of power between the physiotherapist and patient.
• There is no dependency on the physiotherapist by the patient.
• Note: There is variability amongst provinces regarding the exact amount of
time that needs to pass before you can date a former patient (e.g. Ontario =
time that needs to pass before you can date a former patient (e.g. Ontario =
1 year). This exam is a National exam thus province specific regulations wil
not be examined.
• Avoid treating family or anyone you have a close or intimate relationship with. The exceptions
h e r e include:
• An emergency situation (fees cannot be charged).
• For example, you are out for a hike with your sister, and they sprain their ankle
really badly.
• When possible, you should not provide services to acquaintances (e.g., someone in your
exercise class, your friend's parent) as there are inherent difficulties in managing dual
relationships.
• It is possible to treat them if:
• You have tried to arrange for treatment from other providers and it is not possible.
- No other therapists treat the condition that you treat.
• In the event that you proceed to treat an acquaintance, you should establish boundaries.
If this cannot be established or sustained, treatments should stop.
• You should disclose your relationship to employers and third-party payers and other
health care providers.
• For example, if you are treating your friend's parent after a carpal tunnel release
and you need to write a letter to the hand surgeon, you need to disclose that they
are your friend's parent.
A physiotherapist must report any incidents or suspected incidents of sexual abuse by a colleague to

Setting boundaries
As a physiotherapist, there are things that can be done to set the stage for a professional relationship
with clear boundaries:
• Introduce yourself to the patient, by name and professional title and description of role in the
patient's care.
• Address the patient by their preferred name or title.
• Engage in active listening in a non-judgmental way.
• Use a patient centered approach in establishing treatment goals.
• Be aware of comments, attitudes, or behaviours that are inappropriate in a therapeutic
relationship and may cause discomfort.
• Obtain informed c o n s e n t to treatment.
• Adhere to privacy regulation.
• Reflect on your own patient interactions.
Warning signs for boundary crossing:
• Spending time with a patient beyond what is needed to meet the therapeutic needs.
• Choosing patients based on factors such as looks, age, or social standing.
• Responding to personal overtures by the patient.
• Sharing personal problems with the patient.
• Dressing differently when seeing a particular patient.
• Frequently thinking about a patient outside of the context of the therapeutic relationship.
• Being defensive or making excuses when someone comments on or questions your
interactions with a patient.
• Being hesitant (except for reasons of confidentiality) or embarrassed to discuss the
relationship between you and your patient.
• Providing the patient with a home phone number or email address unless it is required in the
context of the therapeutic relationship.
m e r d e t o n s w i t h a p a t i e n .
• Being hesitant (except for reasons of confidentiality) or embarrassed to discuss the
relationship between you and your patient.
• Providing the patient with a home phone number or email address unless it is required in the
context of the therapeutic relationship.
• Maintaining a patient on treatment longer than is required.
Sensitive practice
The physiotherapist can make a patient feel more comfortable in the following ways:
• Use clear language when obtaining consent.
Let the patient know they can have someone else present in the room during their session.
• Let the patient know what the assessment (subjective and objective) will entail before you
begin.
• Provide an opportunity for your patient to ask questions.
• Complete the subjective assessment before asking the patient to remove clothing.
Ensure privacy and offer draping for changing or undressing.
• Provide a treatment room that is as private as possible.
• Re-visit consent as needed.
When a boundary is crossed
It is the physiotherapist's duty to establish, maintain and monitor the boundaries of the therapeutic
relationship. When a boundary is blurred or crossed, the physiotherapist must do the following:
• The physiotherapist needs to identify the issue and correct any behaviour by communicating
openly with the patient.
• If the therapeutic relationship can be re-established, the physiotherapist can continue to
t r e a t .
• If the therapeutic relationship cannot be re-established, the physiotherapist should make sure
the patient is not adversely affected by any disruption in care.
• For example, if the physiotherapist discharges the patient but the patient requires
ongoing physiotherapy, the physiotherapist needs to offer them alternative options for
other physiotherapy services and liaise with the new physiotherapist regarding care
once consent to do so is received.
• Document the potential or real boundary violation, the actions taken to re-establish the
professional boundaries, and the outcome.
QUESTION 1 OF 9
Vignette: A physiotherapist, working at a private practice clinic, notices that their
colleague often flirts with their patients when they are of a certain age and
appearance. The physiotherapist has noticed this pattern since their colleagues recent
employment at the clinic.
Question: Which of the following is the best course of action for the physiotherapist to
take to a d d r e s s this issue?
Choose only ONE best answer.
A The physiotherapist should meet directly with their colleague and let them know
that this behaviour is unprofessional and needs to stop immediately.
B Wait until there is concrete evidence of a boundary being crossed and then report
their colleague to the College.
Immediately contact the College and report the issue.
D Hold a team meeting and review professional boundaries to avoid a direct
confrontation.
A. The physiotherapist should meet directly with their colleague and let them know that this
behaviour is unprofessional and needs to stop immediately.
• While the physiotherapist should definitely report this issue, it is not their
responsibility to directly confront their colleague as this could create a challenging
work environment for the physiotherapist.
B. Wait until there is concrete evidence of a boundary being crossed and then report their
colleague to the College.
• If the physiotherapist is concerned about the behaviour of their colleague, they should
report vs wait for some type of direct evidence of a boundary being crossed. If their
colleague is flirting with patients, a boundary has already been crossed and further
investigations need to be made by the College.
C. Immediately contact the College and report the issue. - Best answer
• This is the best answer as it immediately addresses the issue at hand.
• The physiotherapist can report their concerns to the College and then it is up to the
College to investigate the matter further.
D. Hold a team meeting and review professional boundaries to avoid a direct confrontation.
• Holding a team meeting is fine when reviewing professional behaviour, but is not
adequate if a professional is actually crossing those boundaries - this needs to be
directly addressed.
Vignette: A physiotherapist at a busy private practice clinic in a major metropolitan
city notices that their colleague has begun treating their sister who is recovering from
ACL surgery. During their sessions, they can be heard laughing quite loud and joking
around. The physiotherapist finds their sessions to be a distraction but does feel that
their colleague is providing appropriate and effective treatment.
Question: Which of the following is the most ethical way for the physiotherapist to
proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Request that their colleague quiet down during sessions because the laughing is

session.
D
Contact the College to determine the best course of action.
A. Request that their colleague quiet down during sessions because the laughing is quite
distracting to others in the clinic.
• The major issue at hand is not the noise being created, it is that the physiotherapist's
colleague is treating their own sister.
B. Do nothing. The physiotherapist cannot control if others are laughing during a session.
• The major issue at hand is not the noise being created, it is that the physiotherapist's
colleague is treating their own sister.
C. Speak to management about providing better sound proofing in the clinic.
• The major issue at hand is not the noise being created, it is that the physiotherapist's
colleague is treating their own sister.
D. Contact the College to determine the best course of action. - Best answer
• The major issue at hand is not the noise being created, it is that the physiotherapist's
colleague is treating their own sister.
• Physiotherapists must not treat family or those they have a close or intimate
relationship with except in situations of emergency. Given that this clinic is located in a
large metropolitan city, there would be many other physiotherapy clinics that can
assist with ACL rehab. The physiotherapist's colleague should be referring their sister
to another private clinic vs treating them themselves because having a close
relationship with a patient can impair a physiotherapists professional judgment.
• By contacting the College, the physiotherapist is acknowledging that there is an ethical
issue at hand and will be guided on the most appropriate next steps.
A. Accept the gift card but encourage the patient to go out and celebrate with friends.
• When accepting a gift, the physiotherapist should consider if there is an expectation
that they will do something in return as well as the nature of the gift.
• In this situation, the physiotherapist should not accept this gift as the nature of the gift
is questionable.
• It is unclear, based on the information in the vignette, if the patient is interested
romantically in the physiotherapist or not, but, regardless, going out for dinner with a
recently discharged patient is unprofessional.
B. Do not accept the gift card and advise the patient that they cannot date patients.
• It is unclear, based on the information in the vignette, if the patient is interested
romantically in the physiotherapist or not, so the physiotherapist telling the patient
that they cannot date them could create a very uncomfortable situation for both
parties.
C. Do not accept the gift card and thank the patient for the offer. - Best answer
• This is the best answer as the physiotherapist is respectfully declining the gift given the
underlining nature of the gift itself.
D. Accept the gift card and go out for dinner given that the patient is now discharged from
c a r e .
• Despite being discharged, enough time has not elapsed to allow the physiotherapist to
go out for dinner with their patient.
Vignette: A physiotherapist is out for dinner with their spouse, and they see their
colleague out for dinner with their patient. They are holding hands at the dinner table.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Report the incident to the College.
B Do nothing, it is outside of clinic hours.
Approach their colleague to discuss their concerns.
D Talk to clinic management when back at the clinic next week.
This a n s w e r i s correct.
A. Report the incident to the College. - Best answer
• This is a situation where professional boundaries are being crossed and it is the
physiotherapist's duty to report this.
B. Do nothing, it is outside of clinic hours.
• The fact that the date is occurring outside of clinic hours has no relevance.
• The issue is that the physiotherapist's colleague is dating a patient.
C. Approach their colleague to discuss their concerns.
• It is not the physiotherapists responsibility to directly confront their colleague.
D. Talk to clinic management when back at the clinic next week.
• The physiotherapist themselves must report this incident to their College and talking
to clinic management the following week does not guarantee that the incident will be
reported to the College.
Vignette: A physiotherapist runs into a former patient at the grocery store. The patient
was discharged 2 weeks ago after fully recovering from a meniscal tear. This is the first
time the physiotherapist has seen the patient since their discharge. After a brief
interaction, the patient asks the physiotherapist out to dinner.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Refuse the offer and let the patient know that is it because they cannot date
former patients.
Agree to the dinner as it would be impolite to refuse.
Agree to the dinner if the physiotherapist feels that the patient is no longer
dependent on them.
D Refuse the offer but let the patient know it was great seeing them.
This a n s w e r is correct.
A. Refuse the offer and let the patient know that is it because they cannot date former
patients.
• This statement is not completely accurate.
• While the correct answer in this scenario is to refuse the offer, a physiotherapist can
date a former patient if all the following apply:
• A reasonable amount of time has passed since the patient was discharged from
physiotherapy care.
- There is no power imbalance between the physiotherapist and the former
patient.
• The patient is no longer dependent on the physiotherapist.
B. Agree to the dinner as it would be impolite to refuse.
C. Agree to the dinner if the physiotherapist feels that the patient is no longer dependent on
them.
• Even if the patient is no longer dependent on the physiotherapist, a reasonable
amount of time has not passed since the patient was discharged from physiotherapy
care and for that reason, the physiotherapist should refuse the offer.
D. Refuse the offer but let the patient know it was great seeing them. - Best answer
• This is t h e best answer.
• While not recommended, it is possible to date a former patient but there are specific
criteria that must be met (see feedback in option A).
• In this scenario, it has only been 2 weeks since the patient was discharged from
physiotherapy which would not be considered a reasonable amount of time. Because
of this, the physiotherapist should refuse the offer.
Vignette: During a physiotherapy session, the patient begins to flirt with their
physiotherapist. The physiotherapist gets the impression the patient is doing this
because they like them.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Ignore the patient's attempt to flirt and carry out the session professionally.
B Have a respectful conversation with the patient.
Document the interaction.
D Discharge the patient and provide them with alternative options for
physiotherapy as the therapeutic relationship has been broken.
This a n s w e r is correct.
A. Ignore the patient's attempt to flirt and carry out the session professionally.
• It is the physiotherapist's responsibility to maintain professional boundaries and
recognize a potential inappropriate interaction.
• The physiotherapist should not ignore the situation as their silence could be
misinterpreted by the patient.
B. Have a respectful conversation with the patient. - Best answer
• If the behaviour does not change after the conversation, it is within the
physiotherapists rights to discharge the patient or give them the option to work with
another practitioner.
C. Document the interaction.
• This is not the best answer.
• While documenting the interaction and the plan of action would be critical, the first
step would be to address and put an end to the patient's behaviour.
D. Discharge the patient and provide them with alternative options for physiotherapy as the
therapeutic relationship has been broken.
• Based on this scenario, the most appropriate first step would be to confront the patient
and have a respectful conversation about professional boundaries.
• Discharging the patient would be appropriate if the patient's behaviour did not change
after the conversation or if the physiotherapist felt uncomfortable treating the patient
due to their behaviour.
Vignette: A physiotherapist is treating one of their long-standing patients. During the
session, the patient invites the physiotherapist to attend their child's birthday party.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Decline the invite and thank the patient for the invite.
Accept the invite but maintain a professional relationship while at the party.
C Accept the invite as it is outside clinic hours, and the relationship is not romantic.
D Decline the invite but agree to future events so the patient does not feel
disrespected.
A. Decline the invite and thank the patient for the invite. - Best answer
• Physiotherapists should carefully consider the impact that attending such a function
might have on their professional relationship with their patient.
• Physiotherapists must maintain professional boundaries with each patient and seeing
a patient socially can move the relationship from a professional to a personal
relationship.
• The best answer for the written exam is going to be one in which the
physiotherapist maintains their professional relationships and declines the
invite.
B. Accept the invite but maintain a professional relationship while at the party.
• W h i l e t h i s i s n o t i n c o r r e c t
, it is not the best answer for the written exam. As stated
above, the best answer for the written exam is going to be one in which the
physiotherapist maintains their professional relationships and declines the invite.
• If the physiotherapist did feel they could maintain a professional relationship
while attending the child's birthday and accepted the offer, then it would be very
important to remember privacy. The physiotherapist cannot discuss any health
information with their patient outside of the clinical setting.
C. Accept the invite as it is outside clinic hours, and the relationship is not romantic.
• Regardless of whether the relationship is romantic or not, physiotherapists must
maintain professional boundaries with their clients to maintain a therapeutic
relationship.
D. Decline the invite but agree to future events so the patient does not feel disrespected.
• This is not the best answer because by agreeing to future events, the therapist is not
being clear about maintaining professional boundaries.
Vignette: A physiotherapist's patient brings them a Christmas gift which is a box of
chocolates and a $50 gift card to a local restaurant. The patient wanted to wish the
physiotherapist a Merry Christmas and thank the physiotherapist for all they have
done to help them in their recovery.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Decline the gift because it would be inappropriate to accept something valued
over $50.
Decline the gift because of the intent behind the gift.
Accept the gift based on the intent behind the gift.
D Accept the gift because it is a Christmas gift.
A. Decline the gift because it would be inappropriate to accept something valued over $50.
• Physiotherapists need to use their own judgement when determining if a gift is
appropriate or not.
• Based on this scenario, a $50 dollar gift certificate to a restaurant is appropriate.
• An example of an inappropriate gift:
• A patient brings their physiotherapist a Christmas gift which is a gold bracelet.
The physiotherapist should refuse this gift given the potential cost associated
with the gift and personal nature of the gift itself.
B. Decline the gift because of the intent behind the gift.
• In this scenario, the intent behind the gift is appropriate.
C. Accept the gift based on the intent behind the gift. - Best answer
• It may be acceptable to accept a gift that shows a token of appreciation.
• If the physiotherapist confidently feels that the patient is giving them a gift as a token
of their appreciation without any expectations, then it would be appropriate to accept
the gift.
• In this scenario, the intent behind the gift is appropriate - the patient wants to say
thank you. Based on this scenario, the gift would not affect the physiotherapists
relationship with the patient, there are no underlying expectations, and it is
appropriate.
D. Accept the gift because it is a Christmas gift.
• The physiotherapist should not accept a gift simply because it is a Christmas gift. They
need to consider the intent behind the gift, if the gift will impact their relationship with
the patient, and if the gift is appropriate or not.
Vignette: A physiotherapist get home from a day of work and notices that they have a
new friend request on Facebook. The request is from a patient. The physiotherapist
knows that the patient is happily married and has no interest in them sexually.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Ignore the Facebook friend request and say nothing.
B Accept the Facebook friend request.
Decline the Facebook friend request and say nothing.
Decline the Facebook friend request and let the patient know why.
T h i s a n s w e r i s c o r r e c t .
A. Ignore the Facebook friend request and say nothing.
B. Accept the Facebook friend request.
C. Decline the Facebook friend request and say nothing.
D. Decline the Facebook friend request and let the patient know why. - Best answer
• The physiotherapist should remain professional and not accept the friend request.
• By accepting the friend request, they are blurring the boundaries of the therapeutic
relationship.
• The physiotherapist should let the patient know why they cannot accept the Facebook
friend request, so the patient understands the reasoning and the therapeutic
relationship is not affected.
Elements of providing care
A physiotherapy assessment should be comprehensive and must include the following elements:
• Relevant information about the health condition, personal and environmental factors
• Subjective and objective findings
• A physiotherapy diagnosis
• Goals of treatment
• Treatment plan
• Plans for reassessment and discharge
Elements of providing care
A physiotherapy assessment should be comprehensive and must include the following elements:
• Relevant information about the health condition, personal and environmental factors
• Subjective and objective findings
• A physiotherapy diagnosis
• Goals of treatment
• Treatment plan
• Plans for reassessment and discharge
Key elements to providing and refusing care
Physiotherapists must not make decisions about providing care based on discriminatory reasons.
• For example:
• Age, citizenship, ethnicity, race, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression,
marital or family status
When a patient needs physiotherapy, a physiotherapist who needs to discontinue care must ensure
that one or more of the following conditions are met:
• The patient requests the discontinuation.
• Alternative services have been arranged.
• The physiotherapist is unable to provide care that meets the standards of practice because
there are not enough resources available.
• For example, a patient needs more treatment post total knee replacement, but the
hospital does not have the resources to allocate more sessions for them.
• The patient has failed to pay for their treatment despite being notified a reasonable amount of
times, within a reasonable amount of time.
• The physiotherapist is worried for their own safety.
• The patient has not participated in the treatment plan and care is no longer effective.
• A professional boundary has been breached and all reasonable steps have been taken to
manage the behaviour.
Steps to managing a difficult situation
The following steps can help physiotherapists effectively manage a difficult situation (e.g.,
inappropriate patient behaviour or actions).
1. Pull the patient aside and have a conversation about the behaviour.
• Let the patient know what the problem behaviour is and why it is inappropriate to the
physiotherapist and/or others at the clinic.
2. Explain to the patient what the expectations for the behaviour are and the consequences that
wil result if they do not change the behaviour.
• For example: immediately ending the session, discharging the patient from
physiotherapy care.
3. Monitor the situation and follow up with the patient as well as any individuals impacted by the
behaviour (e.g., other patients).
4. If the behaviour stops, continue to treat as per previous.
5. If the behaviour continues, despite all reasonable steps to manage it, the physiotherapist
should choose to stop treatment.
6. Document all interactions and the outcome.
Note: This is a general guideline.
• If a physiotherapist ever felt unsafe or at risk, they should not approach the patient and should
call for assistance instead (e.g., 911).
• If the physiotherapist felt that the therapeutic relationship was disrupted and unrepairable
because of the patient's initial behaviour (e.g., the patient touched them in a sexual way and
they no longer felt safe to work with the patient), they can discharge the patient and refer
them elsewhere without providing the patient with a second chance to change their
behaviour. The physiotherapist safety and maintaining a therapeutic relationship is critical.
PHIPA, HIC, IPC
Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA)
• Physiotherapists must follow the rules of the Personal Health Information Protection Act
(PHIPA).
• PHIPA governs the collection, use and disclosure of personal health information by Health
Information Custodians (HIC).
Health Information Custodian (HIC)
• A HIC is responsible for collecting, using, and disclosing personal health information on behalf
of clients. A HIC is also responsible for storing and disposing of health information in a secure
manner.
• A HIC can be an institution (e.g., hospital, long-term care home, pharmacy) or a private
healthcare practitioner (e.g., PT, OT).
• The term 'agent' is used to define any person who is authorized by a HIC (e.g., hospital
or long-term care home) to perform services on the HIC's behalf. The agent must comply
with PHIPA and follow the policies set in place by the HIC for whom they work.
• In a hospital setting where the hospital itself is the HIC, a physiotherapist working
in the hospital is considered an 'agent' of the HIC.
• A physiotherapist working as the sole practitioner in their own practice is
considered the HIC.
• In a private practice setting with multiple practitioners, there must be clear
documentation to identify who the HIC is - it could be the physiotherapist
themselves, the clinic owner, or the clinic/agency itself. Thus, when working in
private practice, you may be the HIC or an 'agent' depending on the policies set in
place by the clinic you work for.
Patient chart access
Consent to share health information is not required in the following situations:
• In an emergency situation.
• If there is a significant risk of serious bodily harm (to the patient and/or another individual
associated with the patient).
• In a legal proceeding if the physiotherapist is a party or witness.
• When records are released to a regulatory College (e.g., during an investigation of a
complaint).
The following parties do not require consent to access the patient's chart:
1. The patient or their authorized representative (e.g., substitute decision-maker).
• Patients and anyone to whom they give consent should be able to access the record.
2. A health information custodian (HIC) or a HIC agent who is involved in the patient's health care
(e.g., those within the patient's circle of care).
• In the hospital, this would include: doctors, allied health members (OT, PT, SLP), nurses,
and clinical clerks - all people who have direct responsibilities for providing care to the
patient.
• In private practice, this would include any health care practitioner selected by the
patient. For example, the patient's family physician, massage therapist, occupational
therapist, or physiatrist.
• The following are not considered HICs:
• Lawyers
• Insurance c o m p a n y representative
• Researchers for a study
3. An authorized assessor or investigator from a College established under the Regulated Health
• Researchers for a study
3. An authorized assessor or investigator from a College established under the Regulated Health
Professions Act (RHPA).
• For example, if investigations need to be made based on a complaint filed against a
physiotherapist.
Steps to esure privacy
The physiotherapist is responsible for ensuring their patient's personal health information remains
private.
Steps taken to ensure privacy:
Only collect the personal health information necessary for patient care.
Only disclose the personal health information that is relevant to patient care and only disclose
this information to appropriate individuals (e.g. other health care practitioners in the patient's
'circle of care' or individuals with whom you have been given consent to share the
information).
• Ensure secure storage of both paper and/or electronic records. Use proper safety measures to
ensure the personal health information is stored safely (see Record Keeping).
• Ensure the safe disposal of all records (see Record Keeping).
Privacy breaches
If a privacy breach occurs, physiotherapists are required to do the following:
• Notify their employer of the breach and follow the privacy breach protocols set in place at their
workplace and try to manage the breach.
• Notify their patients) of the privacy breach. This must include:
• The event that occurred.
• The steps taken to address the breach.
• That the patient has a right to file a privacy complaint to their provincial 'Information &
Privacy Commissioner' (IPC).
• Analyze what happened and determine ways to prevent the breach in the future - learn from
any mistakes!
• If applicable, based on the breach, notify their College and/or the IPC.
Physiotherapists do not need to report a breach of personal health information to their College or
the IPC if:
• The breach was not intentional.
• The information contained in the breach was not sensitive.
• The breach was a one-time incident.
• The breach was not part of a pattern of breaches.
• For example, you log into the computer system and accidentally see personal
information for a patient who you are not treating. You log out immediately and do not
release any of the information you saw.
• For example, you are talking to your physiotherapy assistant about a mutual patient in a
back room and another patient overhears your conversation. This is the first time this
has happened.
HICs must notify their College and their provincial IPC of a privacy breach in the following
Privacy breaches
HICs must notify their College and their provincial IPC of a privacy breach in the following
circumstances:
• If disciplinary action is taken against a member for a privacy breach (see Mandatory
Reporting) or,
• The breach is due to theft, loss or unauthorized use or disclosure of personal information.
Examples include:
• Personal heath related information is intentionally used/disclosed without consent.
• For example, someone intentionally looks at a person's private information
without a work-related purpose.
• Personal information is stolen.
• For example, a laptop or paper file is stolen or there is a computer software attack.
• There is a pattern of repeated breaches.
• For example, your secretary has repeatedly sent emails or faxes to the wrong
location.
• There is a threat against someone's personal information.
• For example, a letter is sent to the wrong person but then that person threatens to
make the information public.
• There is disciplinary action against the individual who allowed for the breach.
• The breach is significant.
• With any breach, you must consider the sensitivity of the information that was
released. If a letter was accidentally sent to the wrong person but it contained very
sensitive banking and person information, a report to the College and IPC would
be warranted.
• It is also important to consider the amount of information, the number of people
involved etc.
If a privacy breach occurs, we encourage you to contact your provincial College to ask for advice and
If a privacy breach occurs, we encourage you to contact your provincial College to ask for advice and
direction. They can let you know if you need to contact your provincial IPC or not and if more
investigations are required by the College.
Ensuring electronic privacy
Whether using an online platform to chart or an email account to communicate, physiotherapists
must take the appropriate steps to ensure patient privacy.
• Computer safeguards:
• Use encryption and anti-virus software.
• C o m p u t e r s s h o u l d b e p a s s w o r d protected.
• Email accounts and online charting platforms should have an individual profile for
each user and be password protected.
• Passwords should be updated at regular intervals and have a strong level of
difficulty.
• Log out of the computer and/or electronic program when not in use.
• Environmental safeguards:
• Restrict office access to staff only.
• Use alarm systems and locks in the rooms where computers are stored.
• Store portable devices in a secure location when not in use (e.g., locked cabinet).
• Avoid using laptops in public places.
• Position the computer screen in a way that prevents unauthorized viewing of patients'
personal information.
• Limit travelling with a portable electronic device that contains patient information to
essential travel/use only. Limit visibility of the electronic device when travelling.
Email privacy:
• Email policy:
• There should be a written policy for sending and receiving personal health information
by email.
• The policy should address:
• W h e n . h o w . a n d t h e p u r p o s e s f o r w h i c h i n f o r m a t i o n m a y b e s e n t a n d r e c e i v e d vial
• The policy should address:
• When, how, and the purposes for which information may be sent and received via
email.
• Any conditions or restrictions on sending information via email.
• What types of information may be sent via email.
• Circumstances where an encrypted email may need to be used.
• What to do in the event of a privacy breach (privacy breach management
protocol).
• Administrative safeguards:
• Set a notice at the bottom of every email that the information received is confidential
and include instructions to follow if an email is received in error (sent to the wrong
person).
• Use a professional account to communicate via email instead of a personal account.
• Confirm an email address is correct and up to date before sending any information and
double-check that the email address entered is correct prior to sending any
information.
• Update all parties of any email address changes.
• Communicate when you have received an email and ask patients to do the same.
• Retention and disposal:
• Effectively manage emails so they do not remain and collect in your inbox.
• If an email communication has already been documented in the patient's record, delete
it from the email server.
Vignette: A 65-year-old patient suffered a stroke 3 months ago. The patient was
discharged home from the hospital 3 weeks ago and, since their discharge home, they
have been working with a physiotherapist in a private clinic twice a week. The
patient's spouse has been present for every session to date. After their most recent
session, the physiotherapist received a phone call from the patient's spouse. They said
that they are unhappy with their spouse's progress and would like the physiotherapist
to increase the number of weekly physio sessions to 4. What is the best way for the
physiotherapist to manage this situation?
Question: What is the best way for the physiotherapist to manage this situation?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Let the spouse know that 4 sessions a week is manageable and that they will talk
to their receptionist to arrange an increase in the number of weekly sessions.
Increase the number of weekly sessions to 4 by adding in your physiotherapy
assistant (PTA).
Tell the spouse that the patient is slowly progressing and does not require more
sessions each week.
D Tell the spouse that you would like to have a family meeting, including the
patient, at the start of the next session to re-evaluate goals and discuss the rehab
plan moving forwards.
A. Let the spouse know that 4 sessions a week is manageable and that they will talk to their
receptionist to arrange an increase in the number of weekly sessions.
• There is no mention that the patient is incompetent and/or that the spouse is the
substitute decision-maker. So, for this reason, the decision regarding the number of
weekly sessions needs to involve the patient.
• Also, decisions on the number of sessions a week needs to be made based upon the
needs and wellbeing of the patient and not based upon their spouse's wishes/wants.
B. Increase the number of weekly sessions to 4 by adding in your physiotherapy assistant
(PTA).
• While using a PTA is an option to increase the number of rehab sessions per week,
consent for the use of a PTA has not been given by the patient and/or their substitute
decision-maker (if one is involved) and is therefore not something that can be
assumed.
C. Tell the spouse that the patient is slowly progressing and does not require more sessions
each week.
• Again, there is no mention that the spouse is the substitute decision-maker which
makes discussing client care a potential breach of confidentiality.
• There is also no mention in the vignette that the patient is progressing with 2
physiotherapy sessions per week.
• The intensity of rehab post stroke is critical and if patients are willing and able, and can
benefit from more physiotherapy sessions, then this is something that needs to be
explored.
D. Tell the spouse that you would like to have a family meeting, including the patient, at the
start of the next session to re-evaluate goals and discuss the rehab plan moving forwards. -
Best answer
• This is the best answer as it addresses the spouse's concerns without breaching
• This is the best answer as it addresses the spouse's concerns without breaching
confidentiality and it allows the patient to be a part of the discussions and decision
making.
Vignette: A physiotherapist has been working with a patient for 8 months. During this
time, the patient changed physicians. The patient has a complicated health history due
to multiple injuries sustained after a motor vehicle accident. One day, the
physiotherapist receives a note from reception asking if they can release their progress
notes because they were requested by the patient's previous physician.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
A Check the clinic's policies and procedures about releasing the patient's records.
Provide the record to the physician with the patient's consent.
Inform the patient about the conversation with the physician and have the patient
provide the records to the physician.
D Refuse to provide any of the records.
This a n s w e r is correct.
A. Check the clinic's policies and procedures about releasing the patient's records.
• This does not clearly state that the clinic's policies and procedures will respect the
patient's confidentiality. You would hope they would, but we cannot assume.
B. Provide the record to the physician with the patient's consent. - Best answer
• This is the best answer as it involves the client.
• This is a situation where the patient is no longer actively seeing the previous physician
and so they are no longer actively involved in patient care. Because of this, consent
must be gained before any records are released.
• While consent would technically not be required to communicate with the new/current
family physician as they are part of the circle of care for the patient, it is best to ensure
you have the patient's consent as this includes them in the decision making
process/care plan.
C. Inform the patient about the conversation with the physician and have the patient provide
the records to the physician.
• The patient does not need to send their own records, this is something the clinic can
do for the patient if consent has been given.
D. Refuse to provide any of the records.
• Refusal would only be necessary if the patient has not given consent for their release.
Vignette: A physiotherapist is working at a private practice clinic. Patient charting is
done on the clinic desktop computers using a professional online charting platform.
Each therapist has their own login for the charting platform. The computers are all
located in the staff charting room which is for staff only.
Question: Which of the following is the best process to use to ensure the
physiotherapist is respecting the privacy of their patients when charting?
Choose only ONE best answer.
The physiotherapist can remain logged in and keep the computer unlocked but
must lock the staff door at all times.
The physiotherapist can remain logged into the charting program but must keep
the computer locked when it is not being used.
The physiotherapist should log out of the charting program between uses.
D As long as the computer is located in the staff room, the physiotherapist can
remain logged in and keep the computer unlocked at all times.
This answer is incorrect. The correct answer is 'C' .
A. The physiotherapist can remain logged in and keep the computer unlocked but must lock
the staff door at all times.
• Not all of the health care professionals in the clinic are working with the
physiotherapist's patients and are thus not privy to their medical information.
• Simply locking the staff door does not prevent other staff members from accessing the
physiotherapist's patients private information.
B. The physiotherapist can remain logged into the charting program but must keep the
computer locked when it is not being used.
• Given that the computer is shared by other staff members, simply locking the
computer will not stop other team members from logging in as they will all know the
passcode to enter.
C. The physiotherapist should log out of the charting program between uses. - Best answer
• This is the best way to ensure patient privacy when using a shared staff computer.
D. As long as the computer is located in the staff room, the physiotherapist can remain
logged in and keep the computer unlocked at all times.
• To respect patient privacy when using a shared computer, the physiotherapist should
always log out of the charting program when they are not using it.
Vignette: A physiotherapist enters a room to work with a 65-year-old patient who is in
a coma and a family member is present. The family member introduces themselves as
the patient's sister from out of town. They want to know updates on their sister's care
and proceed to ask you some questions.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Answer the sister's questions as they are an immediate family member.
Advise the family member that you cannot discuss your patient's personal
information without permission.
Advise them to talk directly to the substitute decision-maker.
D B and C
This answer is incorrect. The correct answer is 'D' .
A. Answer the sister's questions as they are an immediate family member.
• You should not share your patient's personal information if you have not been given
permission by either the patient or their substitute decision-maker.
• The vignette has not stated that the sister is the patient's substitute decision-maker.
• In this situation, the patient is in a coma so it would be necessary to get consent from
their substitute decision-maker first.
B. Advise the family member that you cannot discuss your patient's personal information
without permission.
C. Advise them to talk directly to the substitute decision-maker.
D. B and C - Best answer
Practice Vignette Style Mock Exam Questions
QUESTION 5 OF 1 0
Vignette: A physiotherapist works in a private practice clinic and needs to contact their
patient's family physician regarding a recent finding they noted on examination.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
A Write a short report and have reception fax the document over to the patient's
family physician.
Contact the family physician but do not make the patient aware of the
communication.
Reassess the patient again during a follow-up session prior to communicating
with the physician.
D Provide the patient with a letter that they can bring to their family physician on
their next visit.
A. Write a short report and have reception fax the document over to the patient's family
physician. - Best answer
• This is an effective way to communicate with the family physician.
• Both the physiotherapist and the patient's family physician are health information
custodians working within the patient's circle of care and thus, consent is not required
to share the patient's person information as it relates to their care. The physiotherapist
is allowed to communicate with the physician based on implied consent.
• The only exception to this would be if the patient has specifically requested that the
physiotherapist not communicate with their physician. In that situation, the
physiotherapist must respect the patient's wishes and cannot communicate with the
physician.
• It is important to chart all interactions with the physician.
Note: Option A is the BEST answer given the options presented as it is not mandatory that
the physiotherapist gain consent from the patient to communicate with their physician. If,
however, one of the options presented included asking the patient for consent prior to
communicating with the physician, this would be the BEST option because it is always ideal
to liaise with the patient prior to communicating with others.
B. Contact the family physician but do not make the patient aware of the communication.
• There is no reason that the physiotherapist should keep their communication with the
family physician a secret.
C. Reassess the patient again during a follow-up session prior to communicating with the
physician.
• There is no reason that the physiotherapist should reassess the patient prior to
communicating with the physician.
D P r o v i d e t h e n a t i e n t w i t h a l e t t e r t h a t t h e y c a n h r i n g t o t h e i r f a m i l y n h u s i c i a n o n t h e i r n e y t
D. Provide the patient with a letter that they can bring to their family physician on their next
visit.
• This is not an effective way to communicate with the family physician.
• There is no guarantee that the patient will deliver the letter and they may not have an
appointment booked with their physician anytime soon.
Vignette: A physiotherapist is treating an adult who recently obtained a traumatic
brain injury. They are a 13 on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). The doctor has stated
that they need repositioning every 3 hours to help heal their pressure wounds.
Question: After several sessions working with the physiotherapy assistant (PTA), the
patient informs the physiotherapist that they would like to stop the sessions with the
PTA. When the physiotherapist asks the patient why, they state that the PTA seems
inexperienced and is causing them pain. What is the best way to approach this
situation?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Discontinue PTA services and talk to management about the PTA causing patient
h a r m .
Tell that patient that PROM is important for their recovery and to be more vocal
with the PTA if they are causing pain.
Let the patient know that they will discontinue services with that PTA and try to
find a new PTA to perform PROM.
D Ask the patient if they would feel comfortable if PROM is reviewed once again with
the current PTA to ensure pain free PROM moving forwards.
A. Discontinue PTA services and talk to management about the PTA causing patient harm.
• This is not the best answer because it does not offer the PTA a chance to explain
themselves or allow the PTA to learn from this situation. As a new PTA, they may need
more physiotherapy supervision with hands on practice/mentorship to improve their
handling skills.
B. Tell that patient that PROM is important for their recovery and to be more vocal with the
PTA if they are causing pain.
• This is not the best answer as it demonstrates a lack of patient acknowledgment and
PTA supervision.
• It is the physiotherapists responsibility to ensure the PTA is performing their tasks
safely and appropriately.
C. Let the patient know that they will discontinue services with that PTA and try to find a new
PTA to perform PROM.
• This answer is not wrong, however, it is not the best answer because it does not
include any follow up with the current PTA to address the main issue of poor PROM
technique.
D. Ask the patient if they would feel comfortable if PROM is reviewed once again with the
current PTA to ensure pain free PROM moving forwards. - Best answer
• This is the best answer as it not only acknowledges the patients concerns, but it offers
a chance to correct any technique issues with the PTA.
A. Decisions about the patient's care.
• The physiotherapist that is designated to take over supervision of the PTA assumes
responsibility for decisions about the patient's care.
B. Decisions about the physiotherapy assistant's ability to deliver care.
• The physiotherapist that is designated to take over supervision of the PTA assumes
responsibility for care the physiotherapy assistant delivers.
C. Be available to intervene by phone if required.
• Once care of the patient is designated to another physiotherapist, they are the one the
PTA would contact if intervention was needed.
D. None of the above are required. - Best answer
• C o r r e c t .
Vignette: A newly graduated physiotherapist has just started a position at the local
hospital. Their physiotherapy practice lead is impressed with their knowledge and skill
and asks if they would like to take on a physiotherapy student next month.
Question: How should the physiotherapist respond?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Advise their practice lead that, as a new grad, they are unable to take on a
physiotherapy student.
Agree to take on the physiotherapy student.
Perform a self-assessment of their competency before deciding to take on a
physiotherapy student.
D Advise the practice lead that they can take on a physiotherapy student as long as
they share the student with a more experienced physiotherapist on staff.
A. Advise their practice lead that, as a new grad, they are unable to take on a physiotherapy
student.
• There is no duration of practice required to supervise a physiotherapy student.
Meaning a new graduate could supervise a physiotherapy student.
B. Agree to take on the physiotherapy student.
• The physiotherapist, whether a new grad or not, should take a moment to reflect on
the decision to take on a student before agreeing to the decision. This is not something
that should be agreed upon out of pressure as it is a big responsibility.
• The physiotherapist is responsible for all care provided by the physiotherapy student
under their supervision so it is an especially important responsibility, and the
physiotherapist needs to be confident that they can take on this role and provide a safe
environment for the patients and an effective learning environment for the
physiotherapy student.
C. Perform a self-assessment of their competency before deciding to take on a physiotherapy
student. - Best answer
• It is the physiotherapist's responsibility to perform a self-assessment of their
competency before deciding if they can act as a physiotherapy student supervisor.
D. Advise the practice lead that they can take on a physiotherapy student as long as they
share the student with a more experienced physiotherapist on staff.
• While not wrong, this is not the best answer.
• The best answer is to perform a self-assessment to determine if taking on a student is
the best decision.
Vignette: A physiotherapist is supervising a new physiotherapy assistant (PTA) who
has not worked as a PTA before. The PTA is currently finishing their kinesiology degree
at a local university. The physiotherapist shows the PTA how to use ultrasound using
in orange in place of a patient. The next day, the physiotherapist gains consent from a
patient to work with the PTA and asks the PTA to perform ultrasound.
Question: What is the next best course of action?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Allow the PTA to perform ultrasound without supervision but ensure that
parameters are provided.
B Review parameters and then supervise from afar in case the PTA has any
questions during treatment.
Watch the PTA perform ultrasound.
D The PTA should not be using a modality on a patient.
A. Allow the PTA to perform ultrasound without supervision but ensure that parameters are
provided.
• The physiotherapist is working with a new PTA who has no experience using
ultrasound. This PTA needs additional support, training, and supervision using
ultrasound before using it on a patient for the first time alone. While demonstrating the
ultrasound task on an orange is fine for practice, the PTA has not demonstrated
adequate competency to perform this task on a patient.
B. Review parameters and then supervise from afar in case the PTA has any questions during
t r e a t m e n t .
• Supervising from afar is not adequate in this scenario.
• Given that the PTA has never used ultrasound on a patient, the physiotherapist should
be right there supervising the treatment to ensure the PTA is competent.
C. Watch the PTA perform ultrasound. - Best answer
• This is the best answer as it demonstrates the increased supervision that is required in
this scenario.
D. The PTA should not be using a modality on a patient.
• PTA's can use modalities with patients if they are properly trained and competent to do
so. They must stick to the exact parameters provided by the physiotherapist.
Vignette: A supervising physiotherapist assigns the task of PROM to a physiotherapy
assistant (PTA). The physiotherapist and PTA have been working together for 5 years
and the physiotherapist feels confident in the PTA's skills and knowledge with respect
to PROM. The physiotherapist obtains the patient's consent to work with a PTA.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Allow the PTA to carry out the task without reviewing PROM.
Review PROM as every patient is different and there is no way to ensure that the
PTA is competent in every PROM situation.
C Allow the PTA to carry out the task and decide on the number of reps/sets based
on the patient's pain levels.
D None of the above.
A. Allow the PTA to carry out the task without reviewing PROM. - Best answer
• The physiotherapist is confident in the PTA's skills and abilities after years of practice
and working together.
• It is not necessary for the physiotherapist to observe the task given the PTA's
experience and competency.
B. Review PROM as every patient is different and there is no way to ensure that the PTA is
competent in every PROM situation.
• Every task performed by a PTA does not need to be reviewed.
• The physiotherapist can make a decision on how much supervision is required based
on the PAs level of experience, competency and the working relationship between the
PT a n d PTA.
• This vignette is clearly demonstrating a PTA who is competent.
C. Allow the PTA to carry out the task and decide on the number of reps/sets based on the
patient's pain levels.
• The PT must always choose the parameters for any task and the PTA must follow the
parameters (e.g., #reps/sets).
D. None of the above.
• Answer A is the correct answer.
Vignette: A physiotherapist performs a new assessment for a patient who is looking for
intensive rehabilitation after a brain injury. Unfortunately, the physiotherapist is only
vailable 2 days a week. The family would like therapy 4-5 days/week. They agree to
et a physiotherapy assistant (PTA) involved in the care. Unfortunately, the patient's
extended health coverage does not cover PTA sessions and they cannot afford sessions
that are not covered by their extended health plan.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Agree to bill al sessions as direct sessions with a physiotherapist given that the
sessions with the physiotherapist are very similar to the sessions with the PTA.
B Encourage the family to continue with the same intensity despite a lack of
coverage as intensive rehabilitation is key for recovery post brain injury.
Provide another option such as a home exercise program to maintain a high
intensity of daily exercise.
D Refer the patient to their colleague.
A. Agree to bill all sessions as direct sessions with a physiotherapist given that the sessions
with the physiotherapist are very similar to the sessions with the PTA.
• This is billing fraud.
• Sessions with a PTA need to be indicated on the chart notes as well as the financial
records (including invoices).
B. Encourage the family to continue with the same intensity despite a lack of coverage as
intensive rehabilitation is key for recovery post brain injury.
• If the family cannot afford sessions, the physiotherapist should not pressure them into
continuing as this is unfair and unethical. The physiotherapist should work with the
family to come up with alternative options that are affordable and benefit the patient.
C. Provide another option such as a home exercise program to maintain a high intensity of
daily exercise. - Best answer
• It is always important to give patients choice. If sessions cannot be provided in the
clinic directly with the physiotherapist, adding in a home exercise program is an
excellent option.
D. Refer the patient to their colleague.
• While it is not wrong to refer the patient to another physiotherapist who may be able to
offer more weekly sessions, it is important to give the patient choice. Simply offering
the patient 1 option, which happens to be a colleague, does not demonstrate the most
ethical way to proceed with a physiotherapy referral.
Vignette: A physiotherapist works part time at a private practice clinic as well as part
time at a hospital. The physiotherapist uses a physiotherapy assistant (PTA) at both
locations. The physiotherapist is unavailable to provide direct supervision to one of
the PTAs when working at the other location.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Appoint an alternate supervisor for each location that can be in charge when the
physiotherapist is not working at the location.
B Appoint an alternate supervisor for the hospital only as the patients being seen by
the PTA are acutely il and at higher risk of deteriorating.
Discontinue using PTAs at both locations.
D Advise the PTAs on the most effective way that they can reach the physiotherapist.
A. Appoint an alternate supervisor for each location that can be in charge when the
physiotherapist is not working at the location.
• This is not necessary if the physiotherapist is still available to be reached in a
reasonable time if there are questions or concerns.
• For example, it could be their day off or they are at another site working but they
still have access to their email and phone and answer them regularly.
• However, if the PTA would not be able to reach the physiotherapist in a reasonable
time if they have questions about treatment or if there is an emergency, the
physiotherapist must appoint an alternate supervisor.
B. Appoint an alternate supervisor for the hospital only as the patients being seen by the PTA
are acutely ill and at higher risk of deteriorating.
• This is not necessary if the physiotherapist is still available to be reached in a
reasonable time if there are questions or concerns.
C. Discontinue using PTAs at both locations.
• This is not necessary if the physiotherapist is still available to be reached in a
reasonable time if there are questions or concerns.
D. Advise the PTAs on the most effective way that they can reach the physiotherapist. - Best
a n s w e r
• The physiotherapist must be available to be reached in a reasonable time if there are
questions or concerns. By advising the PTAs on the best way to be reached, they are
ensuring they can intervene as needed when not on site.
gnette: A physiotherapist works in a long-term care home. One of their long-term
patients tells them that the new physiotherapy assistant (PTA) working with them is
de and makes them feel unsafe. The physiotherapist has not directly witnessed the
behaviour, but they believe the patient.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Given the patient's reported concerns, provide the patient with the option to work
with a new PTA.
Come together for a meeting with the PTA and the patient.
Fire the PTA.
D Investigate if other patient's have reported similar issues while working with the
PTA.
A. Given the patient's reported concerns, provide the patient with the option to work with a
n e w PTA. - Best a n s w e r
• Based on the comments made by the patient, the physiotherapist should be concerned
and needs to act.
• The therapeutic alliance has been broken and it is best to provide the patient with an
alternative PTA to work with.
• The physiotherapist should document the patient's reports and the actions taken to
manage the situation.
B. Come together for a meeting with the PTA and the patient.
• Given the accusations made by the patient, coming together for a meeting could put
everyone in a very uncomfortable position and is not the best option in this scenario.
C. Fire the PTA.
• The physiotherapist cannot fire the PTA.
• While the physiotherapist is responsible for the activities the PTA performs with their
patient, the physiotherapist is not the PTAs employer. Any concerns regarding the PTA's
behaviour need to be brought up with management/the employer.
D. Investigate if other patient's have reported similar issues while working with the PTA.
• This is not the role of the physiotherapist.
• The physiotherapist should talk to management (the person in charge of the PTA) and
come together for a team meeting to address the concerns stated by the patient.
• When discussing the patient, the physiotherapist should only use the patient's
name if they have given them consent to do so.
Vignette: A physiotherapy assistant (PTA) is working with a patient to complete their
exercise program. They have been assigned the task of wall squats. While in the main
gym area, the physiotherapist notice that the PTA has increased the repetitions in the
assigned task of wall squats without consulting them.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Pull the PTA aside and discuss the issue at hand.
B Educate the PTA about the importance of sticking to the prescribed number of
repetitions.
Encourage the PTA to contact them if the exercise becomes too easy so they can
re-assess the patient and adjust the program as necessary to ensure patient
safety.
D All of the above
A. Pull the PTA aside and discuss the issue at hand.
B. Educate the PTA about the importance of sticking to the prescribed number of repetitions.
C. Encourage the PTA to contact them if the exercise becomes too easy so they can re-assess
the patient and adjust the program as necessary to ensure patient safety.
D. All of the above - Best answer
• Changing the FITT parameters beyond what was established is not within the scope of
PTA and is not allowed.
• In this situation, the physiotherapist should pull the PTA aside and discuss the issue at
hand. They should let the PTA know that they increased the number of repetitions
outside of the prescribed number.
• The physiotherapist should take the time to educate the PTA about the importance of
sticking to the prescribed number of repetitions and encourage the PTA to contact
them if the exercise becomes too easy so they can re-assess the patient and adjust the
program as necessary to ensure patient safety.
Physiotherapist title
Only registrants of the College can use the title "physiotherapist."
• This includes variations and short forms such as:
• Physical therapist
• PT.
• Registered physical therapist
• Registered physiotherapist
• And equivalent terms in other languages
• It is illegal for anyone who is not registered with the College to use this title.
• Anyone who is not registered with the Colege who is found using the title
"physiotherapist" should be reported to the College immediately.
Registrants must use the appropriate physiotherapy title when engaging in clinical practice.
• Registrants must not use these titles when working outside of the scope of physiotherapy
practice.
• For example, a registered physiotherapist who is teaching a group yoga class at a yoga
studio, cannot use the title physiotherapist while teaching the yoga class.
Physiotherapist who hold a doctorate degree (DPT or PhD) must not use the title 'doctor' or an
abbreviation of the title (Dr.) preceding their name when providing patient care services as a
physiotherapist. They can, however, use the title doctor with professional colleagues, in academic
settings, or in research papers.
• There are no accredited Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) programs in Canada, so anyone
using those credentials must have received theirs from an accredited program internationally.
• When using this credential, the doctoral degree must be placed after their name and related
physical therapy qualification. For example:
• There are no accredited Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) programs in Canada, so anyone
using those credentials must have received theirs from an accredited program internationally.
• When using this credential, the doctoral degree must be placed after their name and related
physical therapy qualification. For example:
• Benjamin Franklin, BHSc (PT), DPT
• Benjamin Franklin, BHSc (PT), PhD
Registrants with a certificate of provisional practice must use the title "physiotherapy resident" or
"interim physiotherapist".
Credentials
Registrants may use other credentials, but their name and qualification must be in the following
order:
• Their name (as it appears on the college public register)
• Qualifications (e.g., MPT) or title (e.g., "physiotherapist" or "physiotherapy resident")
• Other credentials (e.g., Certified by the Acupuncture Foundation of Canada)
When using credentials, physical therapists can only use an abbreviated credential if it meets the
following criteria:
• It meets an education standard from a University that is commonly known by the general
public (e.g., BSc, MPT, DPT).
Programs that do not grant a University degree are required to be written out in full.
• For example:
• Do not use FCAMPT, use Fellow of the Canadian Academy of Manipulative Therapists or,
• Do not use CAFCI, use Certified by the Acupuncture Foundation of Canada Institute
Professional association, society or body memberships are not credentials, and must not be
conveyed as such.
• For example: MCPA (Member of the Canadian Physiotherapy Association)
Physical therapists who practice more than one discipline must keep their roles, titles, credentials,
documentation, and billing practice separate and distinct.
The use of term, "specialist"
Physiotherapists must not use the title "specialist" unless they receive a specialty designation from a
certification body recognized by the College.
• For example, they must have completed the Canadian Physiotherapy Association's (CPA)
Clinical Specialty program in a specific designated area (e.g., pediatrics, cardiorespiratory).
• They must then apply to the College for approval to use the specialty title.
Physiotherapists can indicate their preferred area of practice or practice area of interest.
• For example: practice limited to hand therapy or physiotherapist with additional education in
pediatric therapy
A. Under the title, "registered physiotherapist", display their training as "pelvic floor
specialist".
• Is it not appropriate to use the word "specialist".
• Physiotherapists must not use the title "specialist" unless they receive a specialty
designation from a certification body recognized by the College.
B. Use the exact wording as their training "pelvic floor training".
• This is not an appropriate way to demonstrate additional training.
C. Any areas of interest or training can be placed on their card using statements like "special
interest in pelvic floor rehab" or "additional training in pelvic floor rehab". - Best answer
• Information about additional education must be communicated as "additional
education in pelvic floor therapy".
D. This information is not appropriate to place on their business card.
• This information may be appropriate for a business card if the physiotherapist wishes
to share it.
A. They should only include the abbreviation 'PT' as physical therapists who hold a doctorate
degree must not use the title doctor or the abbreviation.
• Physical therapists who hold a doctorate degree can use the title 'doctor' or an
abbreviation of the title (Dr.) preceding their name but only during non-clinical
settings.
B. They can use the abbreviation 'Dr! because physical therapists who hold a doctorate
degree from an accredited educational institution are allowed to use the abbreviation doctor
in all settings.
• The credentials of doctor or the abbreviation can only be use during non-clinical
settings such as when introducing themselves to professional colleagues, on research
papers or in an academic setting.
C. The physical therapists attending the in-service should report the misuse of credentials to
their College immediately.
• The physical therapist is not misusing the credentials, so they do not need to be
reported.
D. They can use the abbreviation 'Dr.' because physical therapists who hold a doctor degree
are able to use their title doctor or the abbreviation during non-clinical settings. - Best
a n s w e r
• The credentials of doctor or the abbreviation are okay to use during non-clinical
settings such as when introducing themselves to professional colleagues, on research
papers or in an academic setting.

What is the TTM?
The transtheoretical model is a way to conceptualize the 5 stages a person goes through in order to
make a change. Progression through the stages can be linear or nonlinear as the person can regress
to an earlier stage. Individually tailored guidance based on their stage can increase engagement in
change. Patient adherence to a physiotherapy intervention is critical to the rehabilitation process
because their participation is necessary for a positive outcome.
Physiotherapists should try to understand what stage of change their patient is in and instead of just
pushing them to participate in rehabilitation intervention, should try to understand the patient and
why they feel and act the way they do. Then, through education, recommendations, and support,
physiotherapists can try to help move the patient on to the next stage of change with the goal of
moving them toward the action stage and ultimately into the maintenance stage without relapse.
• For example, a patient is diagnosed with COPD because of long-term smoking. The patient
denies that they have COPD and does not want to stop smoking or receive help. This patient is
not ready to make a change and will therefore not benefit from services. The physiotherapist
can educate the patient on their condition and the benefits of physiotherapy but will not be
able to deliver services if the patient is not ready, willing, or motivated to change.

their behaviour
• Not participating in any
activity to change their
behaviour and fix the
problem
• Have no plan or intention

b eh av io u r a n d
participating in an activity
to fix the problem
• Establish a rapport and build trust.
• Education is key as the patient may be
unaware of the problem or the
consequences of their behaviour.
• The physiotherapist should be
empathetic and ask open-ended
questions in a non-judgmental manner
to gather more information from their
patient. If they are in this stage due to
a lack of insight/knowledge, then the
physiotherapist can educate the
patient to help influence their thought
process and willingness to participate
in rehabilitation.
• The patient may not be interested in
what the physiotherapist has to say. If
that is the case, the physiotherapist
must respect the patient's
opinion/decision. The physiotherapist
can educate the patient on the risks of
not adhering to treatment and provide
them with alternative options.
• Physiotherapy intervention will not
Stages defined and the physiotherapist's role
succeed if the patient is unaware
and/or has no intention to change
their behaviour.
Contemplation Acknowledgement:
• Aware of the problem and
the consequences of their
behaviour
• Aware of the benefits of
changing their behaviour
• Considering whether they
want to change or not
• Still not participating in
any activity to change
their behaviour and fix the
problem
• Ongoing education will be important
to empower the patient to take action.
• The patient will be more open to
receiving information than in the
precontemplation stage.
• Physiotherapy intervention will not
succeed until the patient makes the
decision to act.
Preparation Willing to change:
• Intending to take action
• Starting to prepare to take
action by developing a
plan for change (gathering
information, figuring out
what they need to do next,
setting goals and
expectations for
themselves)
• This is where the patient may call the
physiotherapy clinic to ask for
information on services or to book an
appointment.
• They should provide support and
encouragement as the patient
prepares to start their rehabilitation
journey and is motivated to make a
change.
• During their appointment, the
physiotherapist can work with them to
create goals and can discuss a plan of
action.
Action Changing behaviour:
• Committed to overcoming
the problem
• Putting forward the effort
that is required to create
change and overcome the
problem
• Developing new skills and
insight
• Consistently practicing the
n e w desired behavioural
patterns and actions (but
for less than 6 months)
• The patient is actively participating in
physiotherapy by attending
appointments and adhering to their in-
clinic and home program.
Note: There is a risk that the
behaviour may relapse, and the
patient stops adhering to the
program. If this occurs, the
physiotherapist should be
empathetic, supportive, and
encouraging to get the patient
back into the action stage.
• The physiotherapist should empower
the patient by providing self-
management strategies (e.g.,
independent pain management
strategies, independent home exercise
program).
• The physiotherapist should continue
to encourage the patient's
participation to retain the benefits and
prevent a relapse of the problem.
• The physiotherapist should support
the patient and modify the program
accordingly as change occurs. They
can help the patient see their
improvements through education, the
u c a n f s u t r a m a m a s c u r a e a n d
improvements through education, the
use of outcome measures, and
effective rehabilitation programming.
Maintenance Maintaining change:
• New behavioural patterns
and actions have been
established and sustained
for more than 6 months
• Working to sustain the
behaviour change which is
now part of their life
• In this stage, the patient would have
the skills and tools necessary to
manage their condition (e.g.,
knowledge about their condition,
bracing, activity modifications,
ergonomic adaptations, and home
exercise programs).
• The physiotherapist can continue to
provide positive reinforcement to keep
the patient believing in themselves.
• This is likely the appropriate time to
discharge from physiotherapy with a
home exercise program and/or
integration into community programs.
The physiotherapist can offer future
follow-up support if needed.
• The patient is more likely to continue
with the behavioural changes at this
stage, however, there is always a
possibility that they stop adhering
(relapse).
Stage of Change Example #1
Precontemplation • Fred, a 45-year-old drywaller has been experiencing shoulder pain while
at work and takes Tylenol to manage the pain.
• Fred does not realize that the pain could be due to repetitive use at work.
• Some of Fred's coworkers and friends have suggested seeing a
physiotherapist or adjusting what and how he does things at work, but
Fred is not convinced that this wil be of any benefit.
Contemplation • One day while at work, Fred reaches overhead and his pain increases
significantly. He becomes aware that the pain may be linked to repetitive
use while at work. Fred realizes that there may be something that can be
done to fix the pain.
Preparation • Fred decides to make an appointment with a physiotherapist who comes
highly recommended by a few co-workers.
Action • Fred attends his initial physiotherapy assessment.
• The physiotherapist educates Fred about his shoulder issues including the
mechanism of injury which is overuse.
• The physiotherapist empowers Fred by providing self-management
strategies (e.g., pain management strategies, activity modification, home
This is a case example where the physiotherapist is not involved throughout all 5 stages of change.
Fred is not convinced that this wil be of any benefit.
strategies (e.g., pain management strategies, activity modification, home
Maintenance
exercise program).
• Fred adheres to the physiotherapy program as instructed by the
physiotherapist and starts to see progress in his shoulder issues.
• The physiotherapist encourages Fred to continue to participate in his
rehabilitation given the significant benefits he has received.
• The physiotherapist should continue to modify Fred's program, so it
continues to be effective and beneficial.
• Fred's shoulder is no longer painful, and his strength and shoulder range
of motion is back to normal.
• Fred now has the skills and tools necessary to manage his condition and is
ready to continue with shoulder maintenance through a home program
and improved ergonomics at work to prevent repeated injuries.
• The physiotherapist discharges Fred from physiotherapy with a home
exercise program and tells Fred that they are always there to support him
if future follow-up sessions are necessary.
Stage of Change
Example #2
Precontemplation
• Dorothy is a 75-year-old retired teacher. She suffered a fall while
ambulating at home which resulted in a left hip fracture and a total hip
replacement.
• Prior to the fall, Dorothy was living alone and was unwilling to use a gait
aid as suggested by her daughter and son. She was independent with all
ADLs but had a long history of falls due to poor balance. Her broken hip
was the first major injury sustained from a fall.
• Dorothy is of sound mind and does not require a substitute decision-
maker.
• Day 1 post-op, the physiotherapist arrives to work with Dorothy but
Dorothy refuses to get out of bed and mobilize because she does not
want to use a walker.
• The physiotherapist must gain Dorothy's trust and build a rapport. They
should educate Dorothy about her injury, the surgery, and the use of a
gait aid to support her injured limb. The physiotherapist should also
educate Dorothy about the negative side effects of not mobilizing (e.g.,
DVT formation, increased stiffness, deconditioning etc.). If Dorothy
refuses to mobilize, the physiotherapist should encourage her to perform
bed exercises to prevent additional complications associated with bed
rest.
• At this point, the physiotherapist cannot mobilize Dorothy as she is not
willing to accept/unaware of her balance impairments and current need
for a gait aid.
Contemplation • On day 2 post-op, the physiotherapist arrives and begins to connect with
Dorothy to see how her night went.
• Dorothy states that she wants to get out of bed and realizes that maybe
she is more injured than she thought.
• The physiotherapist highlights the importance of mobilizing in order to
be discharged home. They ask Dorothy if she would be willing to use the
walker to stand and move into a chair to aid in getting out of bed.
Dorothy agrees.
• In this situation, the physiotherapist realizes that Dorothy is more open
to adhering to the physiotherapy program but is not yet fully ready to
ambulate with a walker. The physiotherapist will continue to educate,
support, and suggest additional options to increase Dorothy's
participation.
Preparation • On day 3 post-op, the physiotherapist arrives to see Dorothy and Dorothy
states that she is ready to walk using the walker. She states that after
standing yesterday to move to sit in the chair, she realized that her leg
was quite sore, and she would need to use the walker if she was going to
safely walk.
• In this moment, the physiotherapist should praise Dorothy for her
willingness to walk with a walker.
Action • The physiotherapist immediately gathers the walker and sets Dorothy up
to walk within the hospital hallways. For the rest of her time in the
hospital, Dorothy walks daily with physiotherapy and performs her bed
exercises to build up her strength to return home.
• After her discharge home, Dorothy continues to participate in outpatient
rehabilitation to increase her strength.
• The physiotherapists involved in her care should continue to provide
support and encouragement so that Dorothy continues with her
rehabilitation. They should provide Dorothy with self-management
strategies (e.g., effective home exercises, and falls prevention strategies)
and continue to modify her program so it is effective and beneficial.
Maintenance • During her time in rehab, Dorothy realized that her balance was not very
good. She noted significant improvements in her balance during rehab
but decided that she wanted to join a community Tai Chi class to
continue to make gains.
• In addition to Tai Chi classes, she participates in a group balance/falls
prevention class specifically for seniors which is run by a
physiotherapist.
• The physiotherapist running the balance/falls prevention class should
continue to provide positive reinforcement to encourage Dorothy's
ongoing participation.
Identify the stage of change associated with each statement.
Stage of Change Practice Example
• The patient performs a home exercise program regularly and makes
ergonomic adjustments to their workstation as per the advice of their
physiotherapist.
• The patient books a physiotherapy assessment but then cancels last
minute.
• The patient realizes that poor posture may be contributing to their
headaches.
• The patient no longer suffers from regular headaches but continues to
carry out postural exercises and maintain good work ergonomics.
• A patient works at a desk all day and sits with poor posture. They suffer
from headaches that are exacerbated towards the end of a workday. They
are unaware that their headaches could be related to their poor posture.
Stage of Change Practice Example
Action The patient performs a home exercise program regularly and makes
ergonomic adjustments to their workstation as per the advice of their
physiotherapist.
Preparation • The patient books a physiotherapy assessment but then cancels last
minute.
Contemplation • The patient realizes that poor posture may be contributing to their
headaches.
Maintenance • The patient no longer suffers from regular headaches but continues to
carry out postural exercises and maintain good work ergonomics.
Precontemplation • A patient works at a desk all day and sits with poor posture. They suffer
om headaches that are exacerbated towards the end of a workday. They
are unaware that their headaches could be related to their poor posture.
A. Precontemplation
• In this stage, patients are unaware of the problem or the consequences of their
behaviour.
• That is not the case in this example as the patient is aware that by not performing their
secretion removal technique regularly, they developed pneumonia.
B. Contemplation - Best answer
• In this stage, patients start to acknowledge their problem and the consequences of
their behaviour. They become aware of the benefits of changing their behaviour and
start to consider changing their behaviour.
• In this stage, patients are still not participating in any activity to change their behaviour
and fix the problem.
• In this scenario, the patient is aware of the issue of not performing regular secretion
removal but has not yet acted to make a change which puts them in the contemplation
stage.
C. Preparation
• In this stage, patients intend to take action and are starting to prepare to take action by
developing a plan for change (gathering information, figuring out what they need to do
next, setting goals and expectations for themselves etc.).
• In this scenario, the patient has not yet started to develop a plan for change as they are
feeling quite unsure of what to do next.
D. Action
• In this stage, patients are committed to overcoming the problem. They are putting
forward the effort that is required to create change and overcome the problem. They
are consistently practicing the new desired behavioural patterns and actions (but for
less than 6 months).
• In this scenario, the patient has not yet made any behavioral changes or put anything
into action to improve their overall health.
A. Ask the patient questions related to their new job in order to suggest options around
secretion removal. - Best answer
• This is the most appropriate option based on the patients current stage of change -
contemplation.
• They are aware of the importance of secretion removal but are not sure how to
integrate secretion removal into their new routine of working full time.
• By learning about the patient's job, the physiotherapist may be able to offer
suggestions that can help the patient move into the next stage of change which is
preparation. This would be where the patient begins to prepare a plan of action for
managing their disease while at work.
B. Teach the patient how to perform a new secretion removal technique such as active cycle
of breathing.
• The patient is not yet in the action stage and so teaching a new secretion removal
technique is not the best option.
C. Tell the patient that they will continue to develop pneumonia without regular secretion
removal.
• This is not the best option given that the patient is already aware of the importance of
secretion removal.
D. Advise the patient to decrease to part time to ensure better management of their disease.
• This is not the best option as it is up to the patient to decide if they want to work full
time or not.
• The physiotherapist should support the patient and help them find a solution instead
of telling them how much to work.
Vignette: A physiotherapist enters a room to assess a 20-year-old patient with Cystic
Fibrosis who recently developed pneumonia. The physiotherapist asks the patient
about their disease and secretion removal techniques to gather more information. The
patient informs the physiotherapist that they use a PEP mask but have not been
performing their secretion removal techniques as often as they should because they
stared a new full-time job and do not want to perform the technique while at work out
of embarrassment. The patient understands the importance of regular secretion
removal but is just feeling overwhelmed with how to properly manage their disease
now that they have a full-time job.

Steps to managing a difficult situation
The following steps can help physiotherapists effectively manage a difficult situation (e.g.,
inappropriate patient behaviour or actions).
1. Pull the patient aside and have a conversation about the behaviour.
• Let the patient know what the problem behaviour is and why it is inappropriate to the
physiotherapist and/or others at the clinic.
2. Explain to the patient what the expectations for the behaviour are and the consequences that
will result if they do not change the behaviour.
• For example: immediately ending the session, discharging the patient from
physiotherapy care.
3. Monitor the situation and follow up with the patient as well as any individuals impacted by the
behaviour (e.g., other patients).
4. If the behaviour stops, continue to treat as per previous.
5. If the behaviour continues, despite all reasonable steps to manage it, the physiotherapist
should choose to stop treatment.
6. Document all interactions and the outcome.
Note: This is a general guideline.
• If a physiotherapist ever felt unsafe or at risk, they should not approach the patient and should
call for assistance instead (e.g., 911).
• If the physiotherapist felt that the therapeutic relationship was disrupted and unrepairable
because of the patient's initial behaviour (e.g., the patient touched them in a sexual way and
they no longer felt safe to work with the patient), they can discharge the patient and refer
them elsewhere without providing the patient with a second chance to change their
behaviour. The physiotherapist safety and maintaining a therapeutic relationship is critical.
Vignette: A physiotherapist is working with a new 45-year-old patient who suffered a
radial fracture after falling while at work. During the first session, the patient says a
racial slur towards the physiotherapist. When confronted by the physiotherapist about
their comment, the patient says the same racial slur again.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Confront the client once more and warn them about their behaviour.
Say nothing to the patient but report them to the clinic manager.
Ask the patient if they would prefer to work with a different staff member at the
clinic.
D Immediately discharge the patient as the therapeutic relationship has been
compromised. Provide the patient with alternative treatment options through a
referral to another health care provider/physiotherapist.
A. Confront the client once more and warn them about their behaviour.
• While this is something the physiotherapist has every right to do, confronting the
patient does not seem to be helping the situation given that the patient repeated their
racial slurs after the first confrontation. Also, confronting the patient could escalate the
issue further.
B. Say nothing to the patient but report them to the clinic manager.
• While this is an option, especially if the physiotherapist does not feel comfortable
confronting the patient again, it does not mention anything about discharging the
patient. Given how uncomfortable the patient has made the physiotherapist feel,
discharging them is the best option moving forwards.
C. Ask the patient if they would prefer to work with a different staff member at the clinic.
• This does not address the biggest issue - the racial slurs. Simply moving the patient to
a different staff member within the clinic will allow the patient to potentially carry on
the same behaviour.
D. Immediately discharge the patient as the therapeutic relationship has been compromised.
Provide the patient with alternative treatment options through a referral to another health
care provider/physiotherapist. - Best Answer
• Physiotherapists have every right to discharge a patient who is abusive and /or is
making them feel uncomfortable. When discharging a patient, it is always important to
document the incident.
Vignette: A physiotherapist is working with a 55-year-old patient with medial tibial
stress syndrome. During the second session, the patient mentions the they are atheist.
The physiotherapist follows a Christian fait and has very different personal beliefs.
Question: The physiotherapist is unsettled by their patient's beliefs. They feel that the
patient may be able to establish a better rapport with one of the other
physiotherapists at the clinic. How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
A Continue to treat the patient and redirect any comments made about religion.
Provide the patient with the option to see another physiotherapist at the clinic.
Continue to treat the patient but encourage the patient to respect their Christian
beliefs.
D Discharge the patient as it is within the physiotherapists right to feel comfortable
while at work.
A. Continue to treat the patient and redirect any comments made about religion. - Best
a n s w e r
• Physiotherapists must not make decisions about providing care based on
discriminatory reasons (e.g. religious beliefs).
B. Provide the patient with the option to see another physiotherapist at the clinic.
• Discontinuing care because of a difference in religious beliefs is unprofessional.
C. Continue to treat the patient but encourage the patient to respect their Christian beliefs.
• The focus during physiotherapy services should be on rehabilitation, not religion. Any
religious discussions should be avoided by the physiotherapist and the patient.
• The patient should be redirected to focus on physiotherapy if discussions about
religion are brought up.
D. Discharge the patient as it is within the physiotherapists right to feel comfortable while at
work.
• While physiotherapist absolutely have the right to feel comfortable at work,
discharging a patient based on religious beliefs is discrimination and is unprofessional.
Vignette: A physiotherapist is working in a private practice clinic. Their patient is
rustrated because the physiotherapist is running a bit late. Because of this, they are
being disrespectful to the administration staff and other patients in the waiting room.
Question: What is the most appropriate action for the physiotherapist to take?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Discharge the patient from care.
B Pull the patient aside and have a conversation about the behaviour.
Ask the patient to leave.
D Work on their time management to keep patients from waiting.
A. Discharge the patient from care.
• This would not necessarily be the first step to take given the scenario.
• It would be important to discuss the issue with the patient and, if the behaviour
continued, they could choose to discharge the patient.
B. Pull the patient aside and have a conversation about the behaviour. - Best answer
• This is the most appropriate first step in this scenario.
• During the discussion, the physiotherapist should let the patient know what the
problem behaviour is and why it is inappropriate.
• They should explain to the patient what their expectations for the behaviour are and
the consequences that will result if they do not change the behaviour (e.g., end
session, discharge the patient).
• The physiotherapist should monitor the situation and follow up with the patient as
well as any individuals impacted by the behaviour (e.g., other patients).
• If the behaviour stops, they can continue to treat as per previous.
• If the behaviour continues, despite all reasonable steps to manage it, the
physiotherapist should choose to stop treatment.
• They should document all interactions and the outcome.
C. Ask the patient to leave.
• While this is not wrong, it is not the best answer.
• The physiotherapist should address the issue directly with the patient by having a
conversation about their behaviour.
D. Work on their time management to keep patients from waiting.
• While this is not wrong as time management is important, the bigger issue is the
patient's disrespectful behaviour which must be addressed.
Vignette: A physiotherapist is working with a patient who has very strong body odour.
Other patients at the clinic are making comments and the smell gives the
physiotherapist a bad headache.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Refuse treatment.
Advise the patient that they must properly manage their body odour if they would
like to continue with treatment sessions.
Say nothing as addressing this issue would be disrespectful.
D Address the issue with the patient and offer suggestions.
A. Refuse treatment.
• The physiotherapist cannot refuse or discontinue treatment because a patient smells
bad because this would be discriminatory.
• The physiotherapist must continue to treat the patient.
B. Advise the patient that they must properly manage their body odour if they would like to
continue with treatment sessions.
• The physiotherapist cannot give the patient an ultimatum as they cannot refuse or
discontinue treatment because of the body odour.
C. Say nothing as addressing this issue would be disrespectful.
• The strong body odour is affecting the physiotherapist and other patients within the
clinic.
• While it is a difficult issue to address, the physiotherapist should still address the issue
and do so in a professional manner.
D. Address the issue with the patient and offer suggestions. - Best answer
• This demonstrates the physiotherapist taking the proper steps to improve the
situation.
• The physiotherapist should have a discussion with the patient.
• They should describe the issue as objectively and respectfully as possible and offer
suggestions.
• For example: "Your clothing smells strongly of body odour and it is impacting my
ability to provide treatment to you. Is it possible for you to use deodorant or
bring freshly washed clothes to change into when you arrive for your
appointment?"
Charting requirements
All charting entries must follow these general principles:
• Be dated and in chronological order.
• Be legible.
• Be in English or French.
• Be permanent - there must be a way to ensure records are not lost or deleted.
• Be respectful and use non-judgmental language.
• Be understandable to anyone involved in the care.
• For example, abbreviations are acceptable to use in patient records. The College does
not have a set list of abbreviations for physiotherapists to use but does advise that when
using abbreviations, it is best to spell out the word or term in full the first time it's used
and then use abbreviations afterward. Some organizations keep a list of common
abbreviations that can be referenced.
• Must contain subjective and objective data, evidence, and outcome measures whenever
possible and appropriate.
• This includes information obtained during email or phone conversations.
• Must contain relevant information about a patient's care in enough detail to allow another
health care provider to assume care of the patient or to follow the plan of care.
Basic information
• Patient's name (or unique identifier).
• Health care provider's name (or unique identifier).
• Date of every patient encounter, including missed or cancelled appointments.
• Patient info: demographics info, health, family, social history, patient reported subjective data.
C o n s e n t
F i n a n c i a l r e c o r d s
A physiotherapist who provides a fee for service must provide the following information on a receipt:
• Name of patient.
• Name of physiotherapist, PTA or others who provided care under the physiotherapist's
supervision.
• Date of service.
• Description of care, service, or product provided.
• Amount of the fee for the care, service, or product.
• Any payment received.
Record retention and disposal
Record retention:
• Clinical and financial records must be retained for a minimum number of years.
• The exact number of years that records should be retained varies from province to
province and would not be examined on a National exam.
• The duration of retainment is from the later of the following 2 dates:
• The date of the last patient encounter, OR
• The date that the patient reached or would have reached the age of majority (18-19
years of age depending on the province).
Record disposal:
• When disposing of personal health information at the end of the retention period, it is critical
to ensure that the information is permanently destroyed in a secure manner to protect
patient's privacy.
• This applies to both paper and electronic records.
• Paper records should be physically destroyed before being disposed of or recycled.
• Electronic records should be physically destroyed, erased, or purged in an irreversible
manner that ensures that the information cannot be reconstructed in any way.
PTA documentation
PTA documentation:
• When care is assigned to a PTA, the following information should be included in the records:
• Identity of the PTA who is performing the task.
• Consent was obtained for the involvement of a support person or assistant.
• Details of the assigned task.
• Supervision plan and process.
• Any changes made, or progression of the assigned tasks in subsequent follow up
sessions.
Vignette: A physiotherapist works in a busy private practice setting. They see several
patients each hour during their 7 hour shift. The physiotherapist is typically too busy to
chart after each patient encounter and usually completes electronic charting from
home later that evening or within the following few days. When charting on a different
day, they always ensure to include the actual date of service in their chart note.
Question: Which of the following is true regarding record keeping?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Physiotherapists must chart immediately after a patient interaction to ensure the
most accurate chart entry.
B Including the actual date of service is not required as long as the chart note is
accurate and within a few days of service.
Physiotherapists should avoid charting at home due to confidentiality issues.
D Physiotherapists should chart within a reasonable time frame after providing
services.
This answer is incorrect. The correct answer is 'D'.
A. Physiotherapists must chart immediately after a patient interaction to ensure the most
accurate chart entry.
• This is a false statement.
• Physiotherapists do not need to chart immediately after a patient interaction, however,
they should chart within a reasonable time frame to ensure accuracy.
B. Including the actual date of service is not required as long as the chart note is accurate and
within a few days of service.
• This is a false statement.
• The actual date of service must be included in the chart entry.
C. Physiotherapists should avoid charting at home due to confidentiality issues.
• This is a false statement.
• Physiotherapists can chart at home as long as confidentiality is maintained as
thoroughly as it would be when charting in the office. For example: using password
protection on a computer; logging out of electronic charting system when not entering
a chart note; not sharing any patient information with family/friends.
D. Physiotherapists should chart within a reasonable time frame after providing services. -
B e s t a n s w e r
• This is a true statement as it ensures the most accurate chart entry.
Vignette: A physiotherapist is working in a multidisciplinary setting at the outpatient
rehabilitation department of a local hospital. They speak fluent English but their
primary language is Spanish. Their initial assessment is always written in English but
their subsequent entries are often in Spanish. For the initial assessment, they prefer to
fill out a pre-made assessment form because it helps with the flow of their
assessment. They typically keep the initial assessment form in 'draft' for the first week
so that they can go back and add additional findings made on subsequent sessions.
Question: The physiotherapist is taking a refresher course on charting as a
physiotherapist in Canada. Which of their charting habits will need to change in order
to follow charting protocols in Canada?
Choose only ONE best answer.
The addition of new findings into the original assessment form after a reasonable
time has passed.
Charting initial assessments in English and subsequent entries in Spanish.
The use of a pre-made form for the initial assessment.
D The addition of new findings into the original assessment form after a reasonable
time has passed and charting initial assessments in English and subsequent
entries in Spanish.
A. The addition of new findings into the original assessment form after a reasonable time has
passed.
• This is not an example of correct record keeping principles.
• Additional notes/findings made on the days following the initial assessment should be
entered as separate subsequent entries.
B. Putting initial assessment entry in English and subsequent entries in Spanish.
• This is not an example of correct record keeping principles.
• In Canada, all records must be in either English or French.
C. The use of a pre-made form for the initial assessment.
• Pre-made forms are allowed as long as the therapist is able to document accurately
and enter in all necessary and relevant findings using the form.
D. The addition of new findings into the original assessment form after a reasonable time has
passed and charting initial assessments in English and subsequent entries in Spanish. - Best
a n s w e r
• This is the best answer as it incorporates both incorrect recording keeping principles.
Vignette: A physiotherapist has just finished documenting the last clinical interaction
of the day. They had a busy day and saw 12 patients. After signing off on the last
electronic record, they realize that they mixed two patients up and included the wrong
information in their charts.
Question: Which of the following is the correct way to manage the error?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Delete the chart records that contain errors and re-write the chart notes so they
contain the correct information.
Mention the errors and the correct information during a follow up session in a
subsequent chart entry.
C Add a follow up chart note that includes the corrected information in each of the
patients' clinical records.
D Add an addendum that includes the corrected information to both patients'
clinical records.
A. Delete the chart records that contain errors and re-write the chart notes so they contain
the correct information.
• This is incorrect as the original content must remain readable.
B. Mention the errors and the correct information during a follow up session in a subsequent
chart entry.
• This is not the correct way to manage an electronic record error.
C. Add a follow up chart note that includes the corrected information in each of the patients'
clinical records.
• Adding an addendum to both patients' clinical records is the proper way to manage an
error not adding an additional chart note.
D. Add an addendum that includes the corrected information to both patients' clinical
records. - Best answer
• This is the proper way to manage an electronic record error.
• Electronic entries will automatically show the date and who added the addendum.
• Note: if the error was on paper records, the corrections could be made either by
striking out the incorrect information in a way that does not destroy the information or
by labelling the information as incorrect.
• The correct or new information could then be added to the record making sure
to identify the date the change is made, the person making the change and the
reason for the change.
A. Add the results for the outcome measure into the patient's chart.
• While this answer is not wrong, it is not the best answer as it does not highlight the
importance of referencing the source of the information.
B. Add the results for the outcome measure into the patient's chart but include the
occupational therapist as the reference to the source of the information. - Best answer
• A physiotherapist can include findings made by other health professionals or
information reported by patients or substitute decision-makers.
• This information should be recorded accurately and include a reference to the source
of the information.
C. Encourage the occupational therapist to add the information to their chart note.
• While this answer is not wrong, it is not the best answer.
• The physiotherapist can encourage the occupational therapist to add the information
to their chart note (which they may already have), but it is still relevant information
that the physiotherapist should add into their chart note as well.
D. A and C
nette: A physiotherapist is working with a patient who suffers from low back pain
le to spinal stenosis. The patient calls the office to speak to the physiotherapist
about an increase in their low back pain. The physiotherapist asks a few questions and
then provides the patient with advice about pain management over the phone.
Question: Based on this scenario, which of the following is correct regarding
documentation?
Choose only ONE best answer.
The physiotherapist must record this interaction in the patient's records.
B The physiotherapist must only record this interaction if consent to do so has been
provided by the patient.
The physiotherapist is not required to record this interaction in the patient's
record as it did not occur in person.
D The physiotherapist should not be providing treatment advice over the phone
without a thorough assessment.
A. The physiotherapist must record this interaction in the patient's records. - Best answer
• This is a correct statement.
• If advice or information relating to a patient's condition or clinical care is provided via
phone or email, the physiotherapist must record this in the patient's records. This
ensures that there is a record of the patient's condition, the care provided, and patient
outcomes.
• For example: A patient emails their physiotherapist to explain that one of their
exercises has been causing an increase in pain. The physiotherapist should
include this information in the patient's chart along with any advice they provide
via email when responding to the patient.
• Information that does not relate to the patient's condition or care does not need to be
documented.
• For example: Information on how to submit an insurance claim form or where to
obtain recommended equipment.
B. The physiotherapist must only record this interaction if consent to do so has been
provided by the patient.
• This is an incorrect statement.
• Consent is not required to document a clinical interaction.
C. The physiotherapist is not required to record this interaction in the patient's record as it
did not occur in person.
• This is an incorrect statement.
• If advice or information relating to a patient's condition or clinical care is provided via
phone or email, the physiotherapist must record this in the patient's records.
D. The physiotherapist should not be providing treatment advice over the phone without a
thorough assessment.
• This is an incorrect statement.
• Physiotherapists can provide treatment suggestions over the phone if they feel that it
• This is an incorrect statement.
• Physiotherapists can provide treatment suggestions over the phone if they feel that it
is in the best interest of the patient. The physiotherapist in this scenario knows the
patient and their condition. Providing treatment suggestions would be safe and a
reasonable option given the patient's increase in pain.
• This would not be appropriate if the physiotherapist did not know the patient, their
condition/history etc.
Vignette: During a physiotherapy assessment, a patient reports that they have
depression and are taking medications for this. They have asked that this is not
included in their health records. The physiotherapist feels that this information is
relevant to treatment as the patient's depression could impact compliance and thus
affect rehab outcomes.
Question: Based on this scenario, which of the following is the correct way for the
physiotherapist to proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
The physiotherapist should include information related to the patient's
depression but not their medication in the records.
B The physiotherapist should include information related to the patient's
medication but not their depression in the records.
The physiotherapist should include this information in the records.
D The physiotherapist should not include this information in the records.
A. The physiotherapist should include information related to the patient's depression but not
their medication in the records.
B. The physiotherapist should include information related to the patient's medication but not
their depression in the records.
C. The physiotherapist should include this information in the records.
D. The physiotherapist should not include this information in the records. - Best answer
• If the patient has asked that this information not be included in their records, the
physiotherapist needs to respect their wishes.
• Under the Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA), patients can withhold
or withdraw their consent for the collection, use or disclosure of their personal health
information.
• Patients may ask their physiotherapist to not use or disclose certain aspects of their
personal health information. This is known as a "lock-box" provision.
• Physiotherapists must respect their patient's decisions regarding how their health
information is collected, used, and disclosed.
Vignette: A physiotherapist is working with a physiotherapy student on placement.
They are reviewing charting requirements and standards. The physiotherapist explains
how to manage any missed or cancelled appointments.
Question: Which of the following is incorrect regarding documenting missed or
cancelled appointments?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Any missed or cancelled appointments must be documented.
There is no requirement to document missed or cancelled appointments.
Monitoring attendance patterns can help physiotherapists make informed
decisions regarding patient care.
D B and C
A. Any missed or cancelled appointments must be documented.
• This is a correct statement.
• All missed or cancelled appointments should be documented including the reason for
the cancellation (if this additional information has been provided).
• Documenting and examining the pattern of missed or cancelled appointments can
provide valuable information and insight regarding a patient's condition and outcomes
of care.
B. There is no requirement to document missed or cancelled appointments. - Best answer
• This is an incorrect statement.
C. Monitoring attendance patterns can help physiotherapists make informed decisions
regarding patient care.
• This is a correct statement.
• By monitoring attendance patterns, physiotherapists can make informed decisions
regarding patient care and determine the best course of action with respect to
physiotherapy interventions or referral to other health care practitioners. For example:
• A patient with a spinal cord injury cancels frequently due to severe episodes of
autonomic dysreflexia.
• This patient should follow up with their family physician for further
investigations into the root cause of the episodes.
• A patient with shoulder pain complains of a lack of improvement but has
cancelled 4 of the last 7 appointments.
• The patient needs education regarding the efficacy of physiotherapy
outcomes with increased compliance. If, after the discussion, there is still
poor attendance and a lack of improvements, the physiotherapist would
be within their rights to discharge the patient from care.
D. B and C
Vignette: A physiotherapist in a busy private clinic does not write out their full name
after each paper chart entry. They use their initials instead.
Question: Which of the following statements is incorrect regarding signing entries?
Choose only ONE best answer.
The physiotherapist should be writing their full name after each chart entry.
B The physiotherapist can use their initials if their full name and title were
documented at least once in the chart record.
If multiple care providers who share the same initials are making entries in a
atient's chart, the use of initials alone is not sufficient.
D The first entry must be signed in full and a professional title noted.
A. The physiotherapist should be writing their full name after each chart entry. - Best answer
• This is an incorrect statement.
B. The physiotherapist can use their initials if their full name and title were documented at
least once in the chart record.
• This is a correct statement.
• When making an entry in the patient's chart, it is important to be able to identify who
made the entry.
• The physiotherapist can use their initials if their full name and title were documented
at least once in the chart record so that their entry can be linked back to them.
C. If multiple care providers who share the same initials are making entries in a patient's
chart, the use of initials alone is not sufficient.
• This is a correct statement.
• If multiple care providers who share the same initials are making entries in a patient's
chart, the use of initials alone does not identify who made the entry. Because of this,
another method of signing the record is required (e.g., use of first initial and full last
name).
D. The first entry must be signed in full and a professional title noted.
• This is a correct statement.
• Subsequent entries in the clinical record must be either initialed or signed in full.

this request.
Provide the patient with their records and charge the patient a fee.
C Provide the patient with their records within the next 60 days.
D Gain consent from the physiotherapist to release the patient's records.
This a n s w e r i s correct.
A. Provide the patient with their records free of charge as fees cannot be charged for this
request.
• The clinic can charge the patient, but they can only charge a fee for the administrative
costs (e.g., paper cost, time for administration to copy all records, etc.).
B. Provide the patient with their records and charge the patient a fee. - Best answer
• This is the correct answer.
C. Provide the patient with their records within the next 60 days.
• Health professionals are required to provide a copy of a patient's clinical record within
30 days of the request.
D. Gain consent from the physiotherapist to release the patient's records.
• Consent from the physiotherapist is not required.
• A patient can and should be able to have access to their health records if they request
this.
gnette: A physiotherapy clinic has moved from paper charting to electronic charting.

A. Keep the paper copies as a backup in case the computer system fails.
• There is no need to maintain a duplicate copy when paper records are converted to an
electronic format if a complete clinical record can be accessed.
B. Recycle the paper copies as they are no longer needed.
• This is not a safe way to dispose of clinical records.
• Paper records should be physically destroyed before being disposed of or recycled to
protect the privacy of patients.
C. Destroy the paper copies as they are no longer needed. - Best answer
• This is the correct answer.
D. Keep the paper copies for 6 months to ensure that the records have been properly
scanned and uploaded.
• There is nothing in the vignette that states that the files have not been properly

Mandatory report to provincial college
Any of the following must be reported to your provincial College:
• Any known or suspected incidents of sexual abuse by a colleague.
• Must report within 30 days of learning about the incident but it is encouraged to report
immediately to ensure the patient's safety.
• Must get consent from patient to report their name. If the patient does not give consent,
report using the name of the alleged suspect only.
• You as an individual must report even if your employer is also filing a report because you
might have additional information and it ensures that the incident does in fact get
reported.
• Known or suspected physiotherapist incapacity or incompetence.
• Examples include:
• Suspected or known intoxication of a colleague while at work.
• Colleague performing treatments they are not trained to perform (e.g.
acupuncture when not certified).
• Colleague has a health condition that is affecting their ability to provide safe
patient care (e.g. cognitive changes resulting in poor treatment choice or
execution).
• Lack of judgment that is affecting patient care (e.g., a physiotherapist is knowingly
applying a modality to a patient that has contraindications for that modality).
• A physiotherapist had their employment terminated or business affiliation with a
physiotherapist has ended for reasons of professional misconduct, incompetence,
or incapacity.
• A physiotherapist's employer intended to terminate them for reasons of
professional misconduct, incompetence, or incapacity but the physiotherapist
Mandatory report to provincial college
Any of the following must be reported to your provincial College:
• Any known or suspected incidents of sexual abuse by a colleague.
• Must report within 30 days of learning about the incident but it is encouraged to report
immediately to ensure the patient's safety.
• Must get consent from patient to report their name. If the patient does not give consent,
report using the name of the alleged suspect only.
• You as an individual must report even if your employer is also filing a report because you
might have additional information and it ensures that the incident does in fact get
reported.
Mandatory report to provincial college
• Known or suspected physiotherapist incapacity or incompetence.
• Examples include:
• Suspected or known intoxication of a colleague while at work.
• Colleague performing treatments they are not trained to perform (e.g.
acupuncture when not certified).
- Colleague has a health condition that is affecting their ability to provide safe
patient care (e.g. cognitive changes resulting in poor treatment choice or
execution).
- Lack of judgment that is affecting patient care (e.g., a physiotherapist is knowingly
applying a modality to a patient that has contraindications for that modality).
• A physiotherapist had their employment terminated or business affiliation with a
physiotherapist has ended for reasons of professional misconduct, incompetence,
or incapacity.
• A physiotherapist's employer intended to terminate them for reasons of
professional misconduct, incompetence, or incapacity but the physiotherapist
resigned.
• A physiotherapist has been disciplined, suspended, had their employment
terminated or a business affiliation with a physiotherapist has ended because of
unauthorized collection, use, disclosure, retention, or disposal of personal health
information.
- Someone, who is not qualified, is pretending to be a physiotherapist.
• If a physiotherapist becomes aware that an individual (e.g. PTA) is
pretending to be a physiotherapist, they must report this to the College.
• If a physiotherapist has been charged with an offense, they must report themselves to the
College.
• Offenses include:
• Charges under Criminal Code of Canada, Health Insurance Act or Controlled Drug
and Substance Act.
• You have been found guilty of professional misconduct, incompetence or
incapacity with another regulatory body (e.g. you were guilty of incompetence
when working as a physiotherapist in BC but are now working in ON).
• You have been found guilty of malpractice or negligence in a court of law.
• If you, a colleague or employer, find out that your co-worker or staff member has been
charged with an offense, you must report this to the College.
Mandatory reporting to local authority
Any of the following must be reported to the local authority (police):
• Known or suspected child abuse.
• Al suspected or known abuse of a minor must be reported (even if you consider the
child a mature minor).
• This includes if the child is reporting actions or thoughts of self-harm/suicide.
• The physiotherapist must report immediately to local child welfare agency and/or
police.
• Known or suspected abuse of a dependent adult (e.g. resident in a senior's home, adult with
cognitive delay, client post CVA who cannot manage their own ADL's).
• If a patient is dependent on those around them for care due to physical or cognitive
issues, it is mandatory to report this to the proper authorities.
• The physiotherapist must report to local social services and/or police.
• Disclosure to prevent harm.
• The physiotherapist has the right to disclose personal health information to prevent
harm if they believe reporting is necessary to eliminate or reduce significant risk of
serious bodily harm to the patient themselves or others.
• The physiotherapist should report to the proper authorities (e.g. crisis line, police) as
soon as they become aware of the information.
• The following circumstances may warrant the disclosure of information:
• There is a clear risk to an identifiable person or group of persons.
• The following circumstances may warrant the disclosure of information:
• There is a clear risk to an identifiable person or group of persons.
• For example: A patient who claims they have already harmed someone or a
group of people.
• There is a risk of serious bodily harm or death.
• For example: A patient who has made threats against someone else -
claiming they are going to harm someone or a group of people.
• The danger is imminent.
• For example: A patient who has made threats of suicide and the
physiotherapist is concerned that the threat is real and imminent.
Mandatory reporting to work safe board
y of the following must be reported to the patient's provincially recognized work safe
board (e.g. Workers Compensation Board (WCB) in AB and BC; Workplace Safety and Insurance
Board (WSIB) in ON):
• The patient reports that they were injured at work but requests that the physiotherapists not
report the injury to WCB/WSIB.
• According to the Workers' Compensation Act you must forward a report to WCB/WSIB
within two days of the patient's visit.
A. Immediately contact the patient's mother and request a family meeting.
• Contacting the patient's mother may not necessarily be the safest option for the child
or ensure that proper steps are made to keep the child safe.
• A third party should be involved such as the police or child welfare agency/social
services.
B. Respect the patient's privacy as their life is not at risk and they have been deemed a
mature minor.
• Al suspected or known abuse of a minor must be reported (even if they are consider
child a mature minor).
C. Call social services to inform them of the situation. - Best answer
• This is the best course of action to ensure the patient's safety.
D. Advise the patient to seek out support through a local abuse hotline.
• This is not an appropriate way to manage this situation as the child may not seek out
any help.
A. Tell the patient that they must immediately report them to their provincial work safe
board. - Best answer
• If a patient reports that they were injured while at work and have not yet reported the
incident, physiotherapists must forward a report to their provincial work safe board
(e.g., Workers Compensation Board (WCB) in BC; Workplace Safety and Insurance
Board (WSIB) in ON) within 2 days of the patient's visit.
B. Continue to treat the patient as it is within their own right to pay for physiotherapy
services privately.
• Physiotherapists must report the incident.
C. Agree to continue to treat as long as the patient eventually tells their employer about the
incident.
• There is no guarantee that the patient will talk to their employer and the
physiotherapists must report the incident.
D. Ensure detailed and accurate documentation of all patient findings and interactions.
• This answer is not wrong, however, it is not the best answer.
This a n s w e r i s correct.
A. Allow their colleague to come to terms with their diagnosis and speak to the head of the
department when they feel ready.
• Any known or suspected physiotherapist incapacity or incompetence must be reported
to the provincial College under which the physiotherapist is registered.
• In this situation, the colleague has a health condition that could affect their ability to
provide safe patient care.
• The physiotherapist should not wait until their colleague feels ready as something very
dangerous could occur in the meantime.
B. Report the physiotherapist to the head of the physiotherapy department.
• This answer is not wrong, however, it is not the best answer.
• The best answer includes reporting the patient to their College as the College can
assess the situation without any pre-existing biases. The head of the physiotherapy
department may not act in an unbiased manner given they have a professional
relationship with the physiotherapist.
C. Contact their colleague's spouse and get them to encourage early retirement.
• The physiotherapist needs to act immediately and report to the College.
D. Report the physiotherapist to the College. - Best answer
• This is the best and most appropriate course of action.
A. The physiotherapist should immediately let their supervisor know of the issue at hand. -
Best answer
• The physiotherapist should immediately let their supervisor (clinic manager/owner)
know of the issue at hand so they can intervene and prevent the physiotherapist from
seeing any clients. Patient safety is paramount.
B. The physiotherapist should wait to report the incident to their provincial College as there
is no concrete proof.
• This is an incorrect option.
• Any known or suspected physiotherapist incapacity or incompetence must be reported
to the provincial College under which the physiotherapist is registered.
• The physiotherapist should not wait until there is concrete proof. If they have concerns
about their colleague's capacity to deliver safe care, they should report the incident
and allow the College to investigate.
C. The physiotherapist should monitor their colleague's actions to see if they are truly
intoxicated.
• This is an incorrect option.
• It is not the physiotherapist's job to monitor their colleague.
• If the physiotherapist has concerns about their colleague's capacity to deliver safe care,
they should report the incident and allow the College to investigate.
D. The physiotherapist should notify their colleague's patient.
• This is an incorrect option.
• The physiotherapist should intervene by talking to management and not by speaking
to their colleague's patient directly.
Vignette: While at work, a physiotherapist overhears their colleague having a
conversation on the phone. The physiotherapist's colleague states that they were
cently arrested for drinking and driving and were sentenced to mandatory sobriety
meetings and lost their driver's license for 2 years.
Question: What is the best way for the physiotherapist to manage this situation?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Say and do nothing.
B Report their colleague to the College.
Ask their colleague if they have reported the incident to the College.
D Bring the incident up in team rounds.
A. Say and do nothing.
• If a colleague or employer finds out that their co-worker or staff member has been
charged with an offence, they must report this to the College. This ensures that the
offence is reported.
B. Report their colleague to the College. - Best answer
• If a physiotherapist has been charged with an offence, they must report themselves to
the College.
• The physiotherapist's colleague may have already reported it themselves but, if not, it
is important that it is reported so that the College can follow up with the claim.
C. Ask their colleague if they have reported the incident to the College.
• It is not the physiotherapist's responsibility to confront their co-worker.
D. Bring the incident up in team rounds.
• This would be inappropriate and is not the correct answer.
Vignette: A physiotherapist is working at a new clinic. The owner is a kinesiologist with
many years of experience. While at the clinic, the physiotherapist overhears the owner
telling individuals that they are a physiotherapist. They also claim to be a
lysiotherapist on social media when advertising for the clinic. They are not directly
treating clients and their claims seem harmless.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Report this to the College.
B Do not report to the College as the owner is not actually treating clients.
Have a conversation with the owner to let them know that they cannot call
themselves a physiotherapist.
D A and C
A. Report this to the College. - Best answer
• If a physiotherapist becomes aware that an individual, who is not qualified, is
pretending to be a physiotherapist, they must report this to the College.
B. Do not report to the College as the owner is not actually treating clients.
• Even if they are not treating clients at present, the owner is claiming to be a
physiotherapist when they are not qualified or registered as one.
C. Have a conversation with the owner to let them know that they cannot call themselves a
physiotherapist.
• It is not the physiotherapist's responsibility to confront the owner and this
confrontation could create an uncomfortable work environment.
D. A and C
Vignette: A physiotherapist's client arrives for their session demonstrating behaviours
that would indicate they are under the influence of drugs. When asked, they admit to
being high on drugs. The physiotherapist advises the patient that they cannot treat
hem while under the influence of drugs and advises them to head home. The patient
oes to reach for their keys to drive.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Say nothing as the issue is not related to physiotherapy care.
B Call the police.
Advise the patient to D
Tell the patient they find an alternative way to get home.
cannot drive while under the influence.
A. Say nothing as the issue is not related to physiotherapy care.
• Doing nothing is not the correct answer.
• Driving under the influence is illegal and puts lives in danger.
B. Call the police.
• This answer is not wrong however option C is the best first choice in this scenario.
• If the patient did not listen to the physiotherapist's suggestions to find an alternate way
home and they headed to their car, the physiotherapist should call the police as driving
under the influence is illegal and puts lives in danger.
C. Advise the patient to find an alternative way to get home. - Best answer
• This is the best answer in this scenario given that the physiotherapist knows the
patient, they have not yet mentioned that they should find an alternate way home and,
there is no mention of the patient acting in a hostile manner.
• The physiotherapist should never confront a patient if it will put them in harm's way.
However, if they know the patient, and feel comfortable, they can advise them to find
an alternative way to get home (e.g., a taxi, or call a friend).
D. Tell the patient they cannot drive while under the influence.
• This answer is not wrong however option C is the best first choice in this scenario.
• Suggesting alternative options would be a more productive and appropriate approach
than simply telling the patient that they cannot drive while under the influence.
Vignette: A physiotherapist is working with an elderly patient who suffers from
bilateral osteoarthritis in their knees. The patient lives with their husband in a
condominium. They are independent will all activities of daily living and are still
driving. During a session, the physiotherapist notices bruising all along the patient's
arm. The patient admits that they are being physically abused by their husband. They
request that the physiotherapist keep the issue confidential.
Question: What is the correct course of action?
Choose only ONE best answer.
A Break confidentiality and report to the local authorities.
Break confidentiality and call 911.
Respect the patient's wishes but advise the patient to report their spouse.
D Respect the patient's wishes and say nothing.
A. Break confidentiality and report to the local authorities.
• In this scenario, the patient is not dependent on the person abusing them and they are
of sound mind. For these reasons, the physiotherapist cannot report.
• If the elderly person was dependent on care because of a physical or cognitive issue,
then yes, the physiotherapist must report.
B. Break confidentiality and call 911.
• Based on this scenario, the physiotherapist should not break confidentiality and
report.
• Calling 911 is also not appropriate as it is not an emergency.
C. Respect the patient's wishes but advise the patient to report their spouse.
• Providing advice about abuse is outside of the scope of physiotherapy practice.
• The physiotherapist should provide the patient with proper resources instead of
offering advice.
D. Respect the patient's wishes and say nothing. - Best answer
• In this scenario, the patient is not dependent on the person abusing them and they are
of sound mind. For these reasons, the physiotherapist cannot report. They must
respect the patient's privacy unless they feel their life is in imminent danger.
Vignette: A physiotherapist's patient recently had a stroke. On assessment, the patient
states that they have vision changes as well as weakness throughout their left side.
During the assessment, they state they are still driving. When asked, they have not
spoken to their doctor about driving since their stroke and their license has not been
taken away. The physiotherapist feels that the patient is not safe to drive.
Question: How should the physiotherapist proceed?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Do nothing as physiotherapists do not decide if a patient should or should not be
driving.
Report their concerns to the patient's family physician.
Report their concerns to the Ministry of Transportation.
D Tell the patient they should not be driving.
A. Do nothing as physiotherapists do not decide if a patient should or should not be driving.
• Physiotherapists do not decide if a patient should or should not be driving and are not
able to restrict a patient's driver's license.
• However, if they are concerned about a patient's ability to drive, they should intervene
by contacting the patient's family physician who can investigate the matter and, if
needed, restrict the patient's license.
B. Report their concerns to the patient's family physician. - Best answer
• This is the best answer.
• If a physiotherapist has concerns about the ability of their patient to safely drive, they
should discuss their concerns with the patient and report their concerns to the
patient's family physician.
• This must be addressed as it is a concern for the safety of the patient as well as
individuals in the community.
C. Report their concerns to the Ministry of Transportation.
• Physiotherapists are not required to report patients with medical, cognitive, or
physical conditions which might cause unsafe driving to the Ministry of Transportation.
• Physicians, optometrists, and occupational therapists have been given the
authority and responsibility for discretionary reporting of potentially unsafe
drivers to the Ministry of Transportation.
• For these professionals, the duty to report prevails over any duty of
confidentiality to the patient.
D. Tell the patient they should not be driving.
• This is not the best answer as it is not up to the physiotherapist to decide if the patient
should or should not be driving. This is why the physiotherapist should contact the
patient's family physician.
Vignette: A physiotherapist is working with a 27-year-old patient who reports that they
e experiencing sexual abuse in their personal life, but they have asked the
lysiotherapist to keep the information confidential.
Question: What is the correct course of action?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Break confidentiality and report to the local authorities.
Provide the patient with some supportive resources in their community.
Respect the patient's wishes and say nothing.
D Band C
This a n s w e r i s correct.
A. Break confidentiality and report to the local authorities.
• If the patient is an adult, they are competent, and there is no risk of imminent danger,
the physiotherapist must respect their wish for confidentiality.
• Note: The following scenarios of sexual abuse would require that the physiotherapist
break confidentiality and report.
• If the patient was a minor, the physiotherapist would break confidentiality and
report the sexual abuse to the proper authorities.
• If the person is being sexually abused by a regulated health professional, the
physiotherapist would have an obligation to break confidentiality and make a
mandatory report to the College.
B. Provide the patient with some supportive resources in their community.
• Providing community resources is an excellent way to support a patient but stay within
the physiotherapy scope of practice.
C. Respect the patient's wishes and say nothing.
• If the patient is an adult, they are competent, and there is no risk of imminent danger,
the physiotherapist must respect their wish for confidentiality.
D. B and C - Best answer
What is a physiotherapy assistant?
Definition: A physiotherapy assistant (PTA) is anyone who provides care on behalf of, or as directed
by, a physiotherapist. There is no specific educational requirement to work in this role. Some PTAs
will have received a college level diploma. Others may have training in kinesiology or athletic
therapy. Some will be trained on the job and others may have a different background. Regardless of
the training or background of the assistant, the same expectations apply.
• PTA's can become members of CPA but are not regulated by provincial Colleges.
Assigning care and supervision
The physiotherapist is responsible for all care provided by the physiotherapy assistant (PTA). When
assigning care, the supervising physiotherapist must consider the risks of assigning care and
whether it is in the patient's best interest.
• The physiotherapist is not able to assign care to a relative or person they have a close
relationship.
• Some provinces require that all physiotherapists who work with PTAs be listed on a public
register.
Principles of assigning care:
• Assign only activities that they have the knowledge, skill and judgement to perform.
• Ensure that the supervised person has the knowledge, skill and judgement to deliver safe and
competent care.
• Ensuring competency should be done before any care is assigned.
• If another qualified person, for example a physiotherapy co-worker or team member has
evaluated the competence of the PTA, it is possible to rely on their judgement.
• For the exam, we would suggest that you always verify the PTA's knowledge
yourself.
• The physiotherapist must adjust the level of supervision in accordance with the patient's
needs - more supervision is required for a higher risk patient.
• Discuss the roles and responsibilities of the physiotherapist and the PTA with each patient.
They should know the PTA by name and job title and give their consent to the care.
• Make the PTA aware that the patient's consent can be revoked at any time.
• Instruct the PTA to recognize any adverse treatment reactions.
• Review when they should cease treatment and advise them to immediately report to the
appropriate person as indicated in the supervision plan.
• Reassess the patient and assigned task at timely intervals.
• Reassess the patient and assigned task at timely intervals.
• Make any changes to the treatment plan, including terminating the assigned task
appropriately.
• Discontinue the PTAs involvement in a patient's care if their actions place the patient at risk or
if the patient withdraws their consent to treatment by the PTA.
Supervision may include any of the following:
• Direct observation
• Periodic chart reviews
• Discussions about patient
• Email or other means of communication
The PTA should contact the supervising physiotherapist if any of the following occur:
• The patient becomes medically unstable.
• There is a change in the patient's condition.
• If a patient or the PTA have a question about the treatment.
• If the patient appears to have plateaued and requires a re-assessment by the physiotherapist.
If the physiotherapist cannot be reached, they must designate another physiotherapist with whom
the PTA can contact.
• If this happens, a transfer of care takes place.
• The alternate supervisor assumes responsibility for decisions about the patient's care and the
care the PTA delivers.
• A physiotherapist who agrees to be the alternate contact for a PTA must:
• Be able to assume this responsibility.
• Have the knowledge, skill, and judgement to perform the assigned care.
• Be available to intervene according to the communication protocol.
When assigning care is not appropriate
Physiotherapists must not assign any physiotherapy task, which has an evaluation component that
immediately influences the treatment program.
A physiotherapist must not assign the following tasks to a PTA:
• Interpretation of referrals, diagnosis, or prognosis.
• Performance of assessment/evaluative procedures.
• Interpretation of assessment findings.
• Discussion of physiotherapy diagnosis or treatment rationale with anyone other than the
physiotherapist.
• Planning or initiating physiotherapy treatment goals or programs.
• Tasks requiring a physiotherapist's clinical judgment.
• Modification of treatment beyond established limits.
• Completion of documentation that is the physiotherapist's responsibility.
• Teaching of the assigned task to another person.
• Discharge planning.
• Any controlled act that has been delegated to the physiotherapist (e.g. acupuncture, spinal
manipulations, treating wound below dermis, pelvic internal exams).
Examples of appropriate PTA tasks:
• Fit/adjust an assistive/ambulation device
• Supervise exercise activities including gait training
• Apply modalities (with pre-determined prescription)
• Collect objective date for the physiotherapist as long as they are deemed competent to do so
(e.g., outcome measures)
If you do not feel your PTA has the appropriate skills to perform the assigned task, you can work with
them to help them gain confidence, and, when deemed ready, you can assign the task. Possible
ideas include:
(e.g., outcome measures)
If you do not feel your PTA has the appropriate skills to perform the assigned task, you can work with
them to help them gain confidence, and, when deemed ready, you can assign the task. Possible
ideas include:
• Teach the PTA the task and have them watch you perform it.
• Let the PTA practice the task.
• Watch the PTA perform the assigned task.
• Provide education and training to fill any gaps identified.
D o c u m e n t a t i o n
Documentation by the physiotherapist must include:
• Identity of the PTA who is performing the task.
• That consent has been provided by the patient to work with the PTA.
• Details of the assigned task.
• Any changes made, or progression of the assigned tasks in subsequent follow up sessions.
• Supervision plan and process.
• How often and in what manner will the physiotherapist discuss patient care with the
PTA.
• Contact information for the physiotherapist (for example, pager, phone number, come to
their office).
• Contact information for the alternate supervisor if the physiotherapist cannot be
reached.
Physiotherapists are NOT required to co-sign notes made by PTA.
• Physiotherapists DO need to review the PTAs chart records to ensure an accurate reflection of
care provided and audit notes to make sure they are meeting College standards.
Billing
• Ensure the PTA's name and job title appear on invoices whenever they have provided the
treatment.
Physiotherapy student supervision
When a physiotherapist is supervising a physiotherapy student, they must consider the following:
• Ensure that patient records and related documentation completed by a physiotherapy student
include the student's name and status, and the co-signature of the student's direct supervisor.
• The supervising physiotherapist must directly observe the student's performance and
determine their level of competence when the student is learning a new skill.
A physiotherapy student can provide a physiotherapy assessment and treatment virtually as long as
their physiotherapy supervisor has confidence that the student has the knowledge, skills, and
judgment to do so safely and competently.
• The physiotherapy supervisor should review specific aspects of providing care virtually such as
safety and obtaining consent with their student before having them provide care virtually.
Vignette: A physiotherapist is treating an adult who recently obtained a traumatic
brain injury. They are a 13 on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). The doctor has stated
that they need repositioning every 3 hours to help heal their pressure wounds.
uestion: While performing repositioning, the physiotherapist gets called away to
ork with another patient. The physiotherapist assigns the task of passive range of
motion (PROM) to a new physiotherapy assistant (PTA). When documenting the
transfer of task, which of the following is not required for the physiotherapist to

D Details of the assigned task.
A. Identity of the PTA who is performing the task.
• This is required in the physiotherapists documentation.
B. The physiotherapist has co-signed the PTA's chart entry after working with the patient. -
B e s t a n s w e r
• Physiotherapists do not need to co-sign chart notes made by the PTA.
• Physiotherapists, however, do need to review the chart records to ensure an accurate
reflection of care provided and audit notes to make sure they are meeting college
standards.
C. How to contact the physiotherapist if something changes with the patient's status.
• This is required in the physiotherapists documentation.
• The PTA should contact the supervising physiotherapist if any of the following occur:
• The patient becomes medically unstable.
• There is a change in the patient's condition.
• If a patient or the PTA has a question about the treatment.
• If the patient appears to have plateaued and requires a re-assessment by the
physiotherapist.
D. Details of the assigned task.

Vignette: A physiotherapist is treating an adult who recently obtained a traumatic
brain injury. They are a 13 on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). The doctor has stated
that they need repositioning every 3 hours to help heal their pressure wounds.
Question: After several sessions working with the physiotherapy assistant (PTA), the
patient informs the physiotherapist that they would like to stop the sessions with the
PTA. When the physiotherapist asks the patient why, they state that the PTA seems
inexperienced and is causing them pain. What is the best way to approach this
s i t u a t i o n ?
Choose only ONE best answer.
Discontinue PTA services and talk to management about the PTA causing patient
harm.
Tell that patient that PROM is important for their recovery and to be more vocal
with the PTA if they are causing pain.
Let the patient know that they will discontinue services with that PTA and try to
find a new PTA to perform PROM.
D Ask the patient if they would feel comfortable if PROM is reviewed once again with
the current PTA to ensure pain free PROM moving forwards.
